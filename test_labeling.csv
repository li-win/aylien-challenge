"Sen. Bennet, Michael F. - (D - CO) News Release","Washington, D.C. - Colorado U.S. Senator Michael Bennet announced today he will join the new, bipartisan Senate Climate Solutions Caucus formed by U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D- Del.) and Mike Braun (R-Ind.). The caucus is bringing together an equal number of Republicans and Democrats to craft and advance bipartisan solutions to address climate change. In addition to Bennet, five additional senators joined the newly-formed caucus: Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Angus King (I-Maine), and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).

""To effectively address the climate crisis we need enduring solutions - ones that won't whipsaw back and forth with changing political winds,"" said Bennet. ""We need to build the same broad consensus in Washington to address the climate crisis that exists across the country. This bipartisan caucus is a step closer to achieving that goal, and I'm honored to join Senators Coons and Braun and my colleagues in this effort.""

""If we are to make meaningful, sustainable progress toward combatting climate change, both Republicans and Democrats have to be at the table,"" said Coons. ""I'm proud to join my colleagues in launching this important effort to take the politics out of this discussion and work toward real solutions. We look forward to continuing to hear from business leaders, workers, farmers, and a range of experts about their priorities and ideas for how we can best address climate change and strengthen American competitiveness.""

""As a life-long conservationist, I am proud to launch the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus with Senators Coons, Shaheen, King, Bennet, Murkowski, Romney, and Graham,"" said Braun. ""For too long, Washington has been paralyzed by partisan gamesmanship, unable to have productive conversations about our changing climate. Through this caucus we can have real conversations about protecting our environment, securing America's energy future and protecting American manufacturing jobs.""

The Senate Climate Solutions Caucus will meet regularly and convene experts from across the political spectrum to find common ground on solutions to address climate change.

Rep. Sharice Davids (D-KS) News Release,"Continuing her work to lower health care costs for Kansans, Rep. Sharice Davids today announced her co-sponsorship of the Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3). This transformational legislation gives Medicare the power to negotiate with drug companies for lower drug prices, and will make those lower prices available to all Americans, no matter where they get their insurance.

""Too many Kansans are staying up at night worrying about the skyrocketing cost of their prescription drugs,"" said Davids. ""This legislation will lower costs for Kansans and stop drug companies from gouging consumers, while saving patients and taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few years. It's time we put people ahead of drug companies, and that's why I'm proud to sign onto this crucial piece of legislation.""

Non-partisan analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found that this legislation will save taxpayers $345 billion in Medicare Part D Spending from 2023-2029. The Office of the Actuary found that it will save households $158 billion and private businesses $46 billion from 2020-2029.

H.R. 3:

* Gives Medicare the power to negotiate directly with drug companies for lower drug prices, while ensuring seniors never lose access to the prescriptions they need.

* Makes the lower drug prices available to all Americans, including those with private insurance.

* Stops drug companies from charging Americans double and triple the price for the same medication as people in other countries pay.

* Creates a new, $2,000 out-of-pocket limit on prescription drug costs for Medicare beneficiaries, and stops unfair price hikes for thousands of medications, including insulin.

The caucus is bringing together an equal number of Republicans and Democrats to craft and advance bipartisan solutions to address climate change.

""For too long, Washington has been paralyzed by partisan gamesmanship, unable to have productive conversations about our changing climate. Through this caucus we can have real conversations about protecting our environment, securing America's energy future and protecting American manufacturing jobs.""

""I thank Senator Braun and Senator Coons for forming the Senate's Climate Solutions Caucus and am pleased to be part of it. I welcome the bipartisan, consensus-based approach this group has committed to and believe it will support and expand on the important work we are undertaking on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee,"" Senator Murkowski said. ""Through constructive dialogue and by working together, we can advance timely, pragmatic policies that will help lower our greenhouse gas emissions and address the threatening reality of climate change.""

""We're already seeing more extreme storms, rising temperatures and polluted air that are having a dangerous impact on our well-being,"" said Senator Shaheen. ""Congress has been dragging its feet on climate change for too long - wherever there's common ground, we need to seize it. It's time to cross party lines and take this threat seriously. I hope that through this Caucus, we can put our heads together and have meaningful, constructive conversations that lead to common-sense steps forward to address the direct threats posed by climate change.""

""Addressing climate change is going to require significant private sector investments and a major global breakthrough in innovation and technology. To that end, Congress should explore ways to incentivize the research, development, and deployment of clean technologies,"" said Senator Romney. ""This caucus will serve as a starting point for a productive bipartisan dialogue so we can begin to come up with solutions for addressing climate change.""

""The threats of climate change don't end at party lines, and our work to mitigate these effects can't either,"" said Senator King. ""The impacts of this crisis are already being felt in Maine; the Gulf of Maine, which plays a vital role in both our economy and our culture, is warming faster than 99% of the world's oceans. This is the most serious global challenge of our time, and we have areas of bipartisan agreement where we can start working together to make much-needed progress. I'm ready to join with any of my colleagues - from any political party and any corner of the country - to take meaningful steps that will protect the planet for our children and grandchildren.""

""I believe climate change is real. I also believe that we as Americans have the ability to come up with climate change solutions that can benefit our economy and our way of life,"" said Senator Graham.  ""The United States has long been a leader in innovation.  Addressing climate change is an opportunity to put our knowledge and can-do spirit to work to protect the environment for our benefit today and for future generations.""

""To effectively address the climate crisis we need enduring solutions - ones that won't whipsaw back and forth with changing political winds,"" said Senator Bennet. ""We need to build the same broad consensus in Washington to address the climate crisis that exists across the country. This bipartisan caucus is a step closer to achieving that goal, and I'm honored to join Senators Coons and Braun and my colleagues in this effort.""

The caucus held its first meeting Tuesday with CEOs who came to Capitol Hill as part of the CEO Climate Dialogue, a collection of 20 companies with $1.3 trillion in combined annual revenue and four leading environmental nonprofit organizations that have come together to advocate for federal climate policy. The group discussed their support for the bipartisan development of legislation that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions using market-based approaches that are durable, equitable, and supportive of the American economy.

The caucus held its first meeting Tuesday with CEOs who came to Capitol Hill as part of the CEO Climate Dialogue, a collection of 20 companies with $1.3 trillion in combined annual revenue and four leading environmental nonprofit organizations that have come together to advocate for federal climate policy. The group discussed their support for the bipartisan development of legislation that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions using market-based approaches that are durable, equitable, and supportive of the American economy.

senators chris coons (d-del.) and mike braun (r-ind.) today announced that six additional members will join the newly-formed bipartisan senate climate solutions caucus: senators lisa murkowski (r-alaska), jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.), mitt romney (r-utah), angus king (i-maine), lindsey graham (r-s.c.), and michael bennet (d-colo.). the caucus is bringing together an equal number of republicans and democrats to craft and advance bipartisan solutions to address climate change.   if we are to make meaningful, sustainable progress toward combatting climate change, both republicans and democrats have to be at the table,  said senator coons.  i'm proud to join my colleagues in launching this important effort to take the politics out of this discussion and work toward real solutions. we look forward to continuing to hear from business leaders, workers, farmers, and a range of experts about their priorities and ideas for how we can best address climate change and strengthen american competitiveness.    as a life-long conservationist, i am proud to launch the bipartisan climate solutions caucus with senators coons, shaheen, king, bennet, murkowski, romney, and graham,  said senator braun.  for too long, washington has been paralyzed by partisan gamesmanship, unable to have productive conversations about our changing climate. through this caucus we can have real conversations about protecting our environment, securing america energy future and protecting american manufacturing jobs.    i thank senator braun and senator coons for forming the senate climate solutions caucus and am pleased to be part of it. i welcome the bipartisan, consensus-based approach this group has committed to and believe it will support and expand on the important work we are undertaking on the energy and natural resources committee,  senator murkowski said.  through constructive dialogue and by working together, we can advance timely, pragmatic policies that will help lower our greenhouse gas emissions and address the threatening reality of climate change.    we're already seeing more extreme storms, rising temperatures and polluted air that are having a dangerous impact on our well-being,  said senator shaheen.  congress has been dragging its feet on climate change for too long - wherever there common ground, we need to seize it. it time to cross party lines and take this threat seriously. i hope that through this caucus, we can put our heads together and have meaningful, constructive conversations that lead to common-sense steps forward to address the direct threats posed by climate change.    addressing climate change is going to require significant private sector investments and a major global breakthrough in innovation and technology. to that end, congress should explore ways to incentivize the research, development, and deployment of clean technologies,  said senator romney.  this caucus will serve as a starting point for a productive bipartisan dialogue so we can begin to come up with solutions for addressing climate change.    the threats of climate change don't end at party lines, and our work to mitigate these effects can't either,  said senator king.  the impacts of this crisis are already being felt in maine; the gulf of maine, which plays a vital role in both our economy and our culture, is warming faster than 99% of the world oceans. this is the most serious global challenge of our time, and we have areas of bipartisan agreement where we can start working together to make much-needed progress. i'm ready to join with any of my colleagues - from any political party and any corner of the country - to take meaningful steps that will protect the planet for our children and grandchildren.    i believe climate change is real. i also believe that we as americans have the ability to come up with climate change solutions that can benefit our economy and our way of life,  said senator graham.   the united states has long been a leader in innovation.  addressing climate change is an opportunity to put our knowledge and can-do spirit to work to protect the environment for our benefit today and for future generations.    to effectively address the climate crisis we need enduring solutions - ones that won't whipsaw back and forth with changing political winds,  said senator bennet.  we need to build the same broad consensus in washington to address the climate crisis that exists across the country. this bipartisan caucus is a step closer to achieving that goal, and i'm honored to join senators coons

"Sen. Carper, Thomas R. - (D - DE) News Release","WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Tom Carper (D-Del.), senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, authored an op-ed in CNBC marking the start of open enrollment season, which runs November 1st through December 15th, 2019.

""When it comes to crafting effective policies for our country, I believe that we should find out what works and do more of that. As health care open enrollment begins, there is growing evidence that the Affordable Care Act is working, and it is imperative that we build on its success - not tear it down,"" wrote Senator Carper.

Senator Carper noted that, despite Republicans' repeated efforts to dismantle the ACA, the health care law is working and providing millions of American families access to quality, affordable health insurance,  ""As we kick off the 2020 open enrollment period, 43 new insurers will be offering coverage in marketplaces of states around the country in the coming year. That gain comes on top of the 23 new insurers that were added in 2019.

""And as competition increases in the ACA marketplaces, premiums have begun to stabilize. Some are even decreasing. Next year, premiums for the most popular ACA plans across America are set to drop by 4 percent. Even more encouraging, multiple states will see average premiums come down by double digits in their exchanges next year.""

On Monday, Senator Carper joined Governor Carney, Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro and Department of Health and Social Services Secretary Dr. Kara Odom Walker, to announce that Delaware's Health Insurance Marketplace will have a 19 percent drop in rates for 2020. Maryland, Colorado and Montana will see similar price reductions, due in large part, to the implementation of a reinsurance program designed to help insurers pay for some of their costliest patients.

More excerpts from the op-ed are below, and the full piece can be viewed here https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/both-parties-should-stop-sabotaging-obamacare-delaware-senator-says.html.

""As it turns out, the ACA is more popular now than ever. More than 20 million Americans have gained health care coverage through the law. Nearly 130 million Americans living with pre-existing conditions have critical protections they didn't have before. The law has expanded Medicaid coverage for 12.6 million more Americans and extended the life of the Medicare Trust Fund by 11 years. And this progress was made all while reducing the federal deficit by more than $1 trillion.""

Senator Carper concluded, ""Imagine where our nation's health care system could be today if we had spent the last decade implementing the ACA as intended and making common sense improvements to it rather than deliberately sabotaging it! Let's finally put patients before politics and make the common sense improvements to continue to lower health care costs for the American people.""

"UAE architecture project discusses ways to preserve nation’s
modern architectural heritage [Emirates News Agency (WAM) (United Arab Emirates)]","ABU DHABI, 7th November, 2019 -- Stepping up efforts to document the country’s modern architectural heritage and develop architectural knowledge, the UAE Architecture project, launched under the Heritage and Arts sector of the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development, held a workshop at the Cultural Foundation, congregating partners and experts from the private and public sectors to discuss the current landscape of modern architectural heritage.

Hosted by the ministry, the discussions explored the gaps in the sectors, looking into the systematic regulations and policies needed to preserve modern architecture. The workshop also looked into ways that partners can work together to address the role architectural documentation plays in our society.

During the sessions, Professor Kevin Mitchell, Chancellor at the College of Architecture, Art and Design at the American University of Sharjah, highlighted the importance of modern heritage as an important tool of teaching.

Sheikh Salem Al Qassimi, Assistant Under-Secretary of the Arts and Heritage Sector, said, ""Architecture is a vital component in the broader definition of culture. Great prominence is placed on preserving heritage sites, but it is also imperative to document and maintain under-appreciated modern architecture. The UAE Architecture project is in line with the ministry’s mandate and new strategic objectives to document the country's architectural heritage for future generations."" The workshop was attended by partners and key players in the UAE Architectural landscape, including representatives from Zayed University, Abu Dhabi Department of Urban Planning and Municipalities, the Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabi, the Agha Khan Development Network, Dubai Municipality, the American University of Sharjah, Shurooq, Government of Ras Al Khaimah’s Department of Antiquities and Museums, and Vectors and Stuff.

The brand UAE Architecture aims to create a common space for architectural dialogue in the UAE and will highlight research, documentation and innovation associated with architecture, planning, urban design, and landscape architecture.

The project is also creating the UAE Architecture Index, a comprehensive architectural database/archive and a research reference that combines current and new research on the built environment in the country. Designed to be the first federal and collaborative architecture index to gather and further knowledge creation and education on the built environment in the UAE, the index will be developed and managed by the Zayed Institute for Architecture, Heritage and the Arts at Zayed University.","ABU DHABI, 7th November, 2019 -- Stepping up efforts to document the country’s modern architectural heritage and develop architectural knowledge, the UAE Architecture project, launched under the Heritage and Arts sector of the Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development, held a workshop at the Cultural Foundation, congregating partners and experts from the private and public sectors to discuss the current landscape of modern architectural heritage.

"Investegate | Company News | Corporate, London Stock Exchange, Regulatory News Headlines Hikma Pharmaceuticals says revenue from generics business to be at top end of range","Hikma Pharmaceuticals says revenue from generics business to be at top end of range 

 Hikma Pharmaceuticals said it expected revenues in its generics business to be closer to the top end of its guidance range following strong demand and operational improvements. For the full year, the pharma company said it now expected generics revenue to be closer to the top end of its guidance range of $690m to $720M and continued to expect core operating margin to be in the range of 16% to 18%. For its injectables business revenue guidance was maintained in the range of $870m to $900m for the full year in 2019 and core operating margin in the range of 36% to 38%. Its injectables business in the US had experienced good demand, which more than offset increased competition and the gradual decline in revenue from shortages of pain management products, as expected. Its branded business, meanwhile, benefitted from 'strong growth' in most markets more than offsetting lower sales in Algeria. 'We continue to expect branded revenue growth in constant currency to be in the mid-single digits for the full year in 2019,' the company said.
