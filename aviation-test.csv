"Plane Skids Off Runway at LaGuardia Airport, Crashes Into FenceGaruda passenger plane with 130 on board skids off runway in Indonesia","A passenger jet skidded off a runway at LaGuardia Airport and crashed into a fence as it tried to land amid a blinding wintry mix Thursday morning, sparking a minor fuel leak in one of its wings, prompting evacuations and injuring several people, Port Authority officials say. There were 127 passengers, including Giants tight end Larry Donnell, and five crew members on board Delta flight 1086, an MD-88 headed to New York from Atlanta, Georgia, when it slid off the runway around 11 a.m., authorities said. Two dozen people reported minor injuries, according to the FDNY, and three of those people were taken to the hospital.  
Passengers described feeling turbulence as they landed, like a rocking motion. One said the jet hit the runway and didn't slow down until it smashed into the fence, inches from the water. The impact caused a minor fuel leak on the plane's left wing, the Port Authority said. The fuel was leaking at a rate of about 1 gallon per minute, but fire crews were able to quickly stop the leak.
LaGuardia's two runways were shut down immediately after the accident and the city's Office of Emergency Management said all incoming and outgoing flights had been suspended. Several LaGuardia-bound flights were diverted and nearly 900 flights were canceled.

Customers with the airlines Lufthansa, Eurowings and Air Berlin flying inside Germany could have their tickets converted into train tickets with Deutsche Bahn (German Rail).
Those flying with budget airlines Transavia were not so lucky. The KLM subsidiary only offered its customers the opportunity to book a flight at a later date or receive the cost of their ticket back.
Many travellers flying abroad were left scrambling to make contingency plans, with buses leaving from Tegel on Friday morning to Hanover Airport, where several flights had been rescheduled, Tagesspiegel reports.
The strike also comes on the weekend when Berlin hosts the International Tourism Fair, which is expected to draw tens of thousands of visitors from across Europe.

"While air traffic controllers in Europe strike, fearing job cuts, industry expects shortage of controllers worldwide in future","While air traffic controllers in Europe strike, due to concerns about pay and future job losses because of the introduction of the Single European Sky, there are predictions of a future lack of air traffic controllers elsewhere in the world.  While the world’s airlines plan to double the fleet of commercial jets during the next two decades as the number of air travellers approaches 7 billion, there is an expected shortage of air traffic controllers in Asia especially.  More and more airports are planned. There won’t be enough controllers to help those 44,000 planes take off and land safely.  There are plans for a cheaper system, for small and remote airports where proper air traffic control is too expensive – get it done by remote control.  A range of cameras and sensors at the airport would relay information to controllers at a man ATC centre, who would direct the planes. The system is, in theory, sensitive enough to penetrate fog and detect wild animals on runways. It is also cheaper than hiring people to fill vacancies at smaller or remote airports. The system is already being tried at a small airport in Sweden. All rather odd, when European air traffic controllers hundreds of job cuts in the next few years. Maybe the controllers are not keen to go to a small, remote Indian airport.",Incident
"Airline bosses call for fewer strikes, lower taxes","Airline bosses have called on the European Commission to legislate to reduce the number of ground air traffic control strikes, and on the European Union as a whole to lift “all unreasonable taxes” on aviation.

Iceland ATC strike disrupting transatlantic flights,"Ongoing industrial action by Icelandic air traffic controllers is not just disrupting traffic at Iceland’s main international airport – it is also having an effect on the transatlantic operations of airlines worldwide.
Icelandic air traffic controllers are currently on a work-to-rule strike over pay and working conditions. They are working their hours, but there is no overtime cover should anybody fall ill. On three occasions since industrial action started, Iceland’s Keflavík International Airport (KEF) has had to shut down to commercial traffic at night time, disrupting the travel plans of thousands of passengers.
On top of this, the situation is affecting airlines worldwide. When there is no cover, traffic passing through Icelandic airspace must be considerably reduced. This means that transatlantic flights using the Iceland route have been forced to take longer, less economical routes between Europe and North America further south – pushing up airlines’ fuel bills.
The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has contacted airport operator Isavia to express their concern over the general situation.",Incident

The ruling is a big win for ABX Air's parent company, Wilmington, Ohio-based Air Transport Services Group, which began flying for Amazon last year, as the Seattle-based retailer tried to diversify its delivery away from UPS, FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service. Earlier this year, the Ohio-based company agreed to lease 20 Boeing 767 operated by ATSG.

People on board the flight reported feeling like they had ‘hit a pothole’ when the plane’s front wheel sank into a 6-inch deep hole – fortunately an identical A319 has on hand to pull the stricken aircraft to safety after a six-hour delay. 
Passenger Derek Navvi said: ‘Just after we landed, we came to a complete standstill and it felt like we had just fallen into a pot hole.’
‘The captain announced that the aircraft’s thrusting engines could only be used for taking off and flying, and this meant that the plane was effectively stranded.’
‘It took six hours to rig a tow rope to another A319 so that we could be pulled back to the terminal. We were told that we couldn’t get out and walk back as other flights needed to carry on landing and taking off.’
We contacted the company who originally laid the new runway extension at Southend Airport, and Cormac McCormac of McCormac Tarmac responded to address the concerns. 
Mr McCormac said: ‘When we laid the new runway extension, we were told by the council that St Laurence’s Church was too close to be able to use regular runway tarmac.’ ‘Therefore, we were forced to use noise-softening tarmac to avoid any disruption to church services. Unfortunately, this sort of tarmac is soft.’

Now the baggage handlers’ union Unite are threatening to repeat the scenes by calling their staff out on a 24 hour strike this Friday.
The dispute is over pay and particularly the failure of ASIG, the main handling company at Heathrow, to implement a pay rise due last year. The company has turned down demands for a 5.5% rise to cover the two year period.  The action is expected to affect baggage handling at check in as well as baggage retrieval from planes and delivery to the conveyor belt system in baggage reclaim. Whilst the airport’s operators have promised to do all they can to alleviate any problems, taking hand luggage only will help passengers avoid the part of airport operations worst affected by the dispute.",Incident

Islamic terrorists hijack a French plane,"four Islamic extremists hijack Air France Flight 8969 in Algiers. The terrorists then flew the plane to Marseilles with the permission of the French and Algerian governments, givenin part because French special forces would be ready to perform a rescue mission. More than two days after the terrorists took control of the plane, during which time they killed three hostages, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur decided touse French commandos to put an end to the hijacking. In the ensuing mission, the terrorists were killed and the remaining hostages were released unharmed, despite the discovery of a cache of dynamite aboard the plane. Hostages claimed that the terrorists had discussed plans to fly the plane to Paris and blow it up.
The hijacking came during aperiod of politicalupheaval in Algeria that pitted Islamic rebels against the country’s military dictatorship. France, along with other Western countries, supported the dictatorship to prevent the takeover of the country by Islamic fundamentalist. The hijacking was designed as a protest againstthis support. The brutal Algerian civil war, which began in 1992, when the Algerian army cancelled an election that the Islamic party was winning, continues to this day. Although the violence died down to a certain extent in 1999 when Abdelaziz Bouteflika–who promised reform and end to the war–was elected president, fighting still breaks out periodically. Despite the resistance of Islamic fundamentalist groups, the army has maintained power. Over 100,000 people have died in the fighting, most of them citizens who were brutally murdered by the regime.",Incident
Hijacking of Lufthansa Flight 181,"Lufthansa flight 181 on October 13, 1977 which was en route from Palma in the Balearic Islands to Germany occurred over the French Mediterranean coast. A Lufthansa 737 airliner was hijacked Four terrorists, who were on board among five aircrews (two pilots, three stewardesses) and 86 passengers had overtaken control over aircraft. The hijackers were lead by so-called Captain Mahmoud who was later subsequently identified as a notorious international terrorist, Zohair Youssef Akache. He ordered the aircraft captain to fly to Fiucimino airport in Rome, where the airliner was refueled.
From Italy, the airliner set off eastwards and landed at Larnaca in Cyprus at 2038 by local time.
It was flown on to Dubai, where, despite being refused permission to land, the crew were forced to do so for lack of fuel. Despite warnings from air traffic control, the aircraft was brought down safely on the taxi track, without permission. By now conditions inside the aircraft were very bad, and Captain Mahmoud was very nervous, acting in an increasingly unpredictable and unstable manner. Jurgen Schumann, the Lufthansa pilot, was allowed to leave the airliner to check the undercarriage, and disappeared for a few minutes. When he returned he was taken to the first class cabin and made to kneel on the floor; Captain Mahmoud then executed him with shot in the head, killing him instantly, directly as a result of Schumann’s earlier, successful effort to feed information about the hijackers to authorities.",Incident
Mystery of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370,"Flight 653 was hijacked en route from the northern Malaysian city of Penang to Kuala Lumpur, the country's capital. The airliner -- a Boeing 737-200 -- crashed into a mangrove swamp as it descended, killing all 100 on board. Before Flight 370, it was the deadliest incident in Malaysian aviation history. The hijacker or hijackers of MH653 have never been identified, despite cockpit voice recordings that captured everything from the breach of the cockpit, to the sound of gunshots that killed both pilots. According to the Malaysian Civil Aviation Department's report into the crash, the aircraft was hijacked as it approached Kuala Lumpur. Amid confusion over whether it was to land there or not, it proceeded towards neighboring Singapore. As it descended, the crew was shot and the aircraft ""carried out some unusual pitch up and pitch down terminal maneuvers before finally impacting into swampy ground at some 450 knots."" The report concluded that the crash was caused by the crew being fatally incapacitated, leaving the aircraft ""professionally uncontrolled.""",Incident
Plane hijacked by Japanese Red Army and landed in Dhaka,"A group of Japanese Red Army (JRA) terrorists hijacked Japan Airlines (JAL) Flight 472 while it was flying from Paris to Tokyo and forced it to land in Dhaka. The aircraft, en route from Paris to Haneda Airport in Tokyo with 156 passengers on board, had made a stopover in Mumbai (then Bombay), India. Shortly after taking off from Mumbai, five armed JRA members hijacked the aircraft and ordered it to fly to Dhaka. At Dhaka's Tejgaon airport, the hijackers took the passengers and crew hostage. The reason given for the hijacking by the JRA was the detention and killing by torture of comrade Hidaka by the regime of Jordan.
The JRA was a communist militant group who gained notoriety for slaughtering 12 of their own members in a training camp hideout on Mount Haruna. The Japanese hijackers had headed to what they thought was an ""independent, Islamic, and popular"" Bangladesh, which would be sympathetic to their cause. They were unaware that a series of coups since its independence from Pakistan had resulted in a martial rather than a democratic government.
In a bold move Bengali Air Vice Marshall A. G. Mahmud, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, then Aviation Minister of the Bangladesh government and one of the country's three Deputy Chief Martial Law Administrator (thus making him the third most powerful person in the military regime), began negotiating with the JRA spokesman on the plane codenamed 'Danke'. While Mahmud was trying to convince the hijackers from the Dhaka's control tower to release passengers, the hijackers were dictating their own terms. They demanded $6 million and release of 9 imprisoned JRA members.",Incident

After taking control of the cabin, the leader of the hijackers communicated with the pilot, Captain Lim, and threatened to blow the plane up if it landed in Singapore. He demanded that Lim fly the plane to Sydney. Lim stressed that the plane did not have enough fuel to fly to Sydney, and that it would crash if he did so. The leader then permitted Lim to land the plane in Singapore to refuel before heading to Sydney, and promised to release the passengers at Changi Airport.13 ",Incident

EU ATC Workers In Single Sky Airspace Strikes,"Expected Air Traffic Control strikes are set to impact heavily on European air travel in coming hours, with both Portuguese and Italian workers protesting at different times.
The Italian ATC workers strike is scheduled for 1300-1700hrs, local time, while there's two phases to the Portuguese ATC workers strike. The first one's time slot has already passed, while the second takes place between 1400-1600hrs, as measured locally. France, too, is set to join these two countries' ATC workers' actions.
Many airlines have put measures in place to keep the flow of flights as smooth as possible but one, British Airways, has already imposed numerous cancellations.
'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers affected by air traffic control strikes across Europe', the UK's flagship airline explained in a statement. 'We have re-timed a number of flights and are using larger aircraft where possible to help more customers, from cancelled flights, fly to where they need to be.

Spanish air traffic controllers to strike,"Hundreds of thousands of British tourists face holiday chaos this summer after Spain's air traffic controllers tonight voted to strike.
The walkout is expected to begin on Wednesday 18 August, a spokesman for the air traffic controllers said this afternoon, and will continue for up to three days.
A final decision on exactly when the strike will start, and how long it will last, will be taken over the coming days, Spanish media reported.
It will be the first time air traffic controllers in Europe's most popular tourist destination have gone on strike, and the fallout looks set to be severe.
A three-day strike would affect 2 million airline passengers during the peak week for summer tourism in Spain. An estimated 300,000 people flying to or from Britain are at risk of disruption.
Controllers and the Spanish government blamed each other for putting the country's already ailing economy at risk by delivering a damaging blow to tourism, which accounts for 11% of GDP.

The controllers are involved in a dispute with Spanish airport authority Aena over hours and conditions.
National carrier Iberia has cancelled all flights from Spanish airports until 1000 GMT on Saturday.
Late on Friday evening, Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said the military had taken full control of all air traffic over Spain after workers refused to called off the unsanctioned strike.
Mr Rubalcaba later warned that if the action continued on Saturday, the government would declare a state of emergency, forcing air traffic controllers to return to work or face criminal prosecution.

Five years of ATC strikes cost Europe €9.5 billion,"European airlines association A4E has published a new study on the economic impact of air traffic control strikes in Europe during its first CEO Summit on air mobility and prosperity in Brussels.
The analysis compiled by PwC reveals that between 2010‐15 the overall impact of ATC strikes reduced European Union GDP up to €9.5 billion at 2015 prices.
It said that unless the situation is tackled, the costs of strikes between 2015‐20 will be of similar magnitude to the entire GDP of Malta.
“From 2010 to 2015, there were 167 strike days in the EU ‐ one disrupted day every 13 days. In total there were 213 disrupted days during this period if you take into account the days before and after an ATC strike as flights had to be cancelled proactively in advance and accumulated delays spilt over to the next day,” A4E said.
Across the EU, strikes occur the most frequently in France, followed by Greece, Italy
and Portugal and resulted in 30,000 cancellations and more than 6 million minutes of delay among A4E airlines.
“The European aviation sector ‐ with 900 million passengers each year – is one of the best performing parts of the European economy. Any disruption has severe knock‐on effects on tourism and other sectors. We cannot let this destruction of productivity continue. These latest figures should provide a wake‐up call for politicians in Brussels and the member states to work together with stakeholders on long‐term solutions to protect individual mobility and European prosperity,” said Thomas Reynaert, managing director of A4E.",Incident

New air traffic control strike hits 1 million minutes delay mark,"Air traffic controllers (ATC) in Europe won’t give a breather to European passengers. Just two weeks after the last walkout in Belgium, French air traffic controllers for the third time in a month will leave their towers ditching consumers and causing further chaos to the travel plans of millions of European travellers for at least 35 hours from tomorrow evening. This will be the 44th strike day in France since 2009 and it will see hundreds of flights being cancelled creating disruption and extensive delays across the continent.
 “During 2016 ATC strikes in Greece, Italy, Belgium and now again in France accumulated already up to a full week of disruption. Repeated and disproportionate industrial action by ATC unions just means victimising passengers and weakening European airlines. We will not stop to call on the European Commission and the governments to act immediately to defend consumers”, said Thomas Reynaert, Managing Director of A4E.

Before the pilots can commence their take-off run a 180 degree turn at the end of the runway was necessary to make use of the full length of the runway. (3,430 Meters)
However, after the tune, when engines where spooling up the aircraft drifted sharply to the right departing paved runway after a few meters. Directional control was eventually lost and the 737 ran over soft ground just north of the runway until it came to a stop 200 meters further with all gear apparently collapsed.
Among the 161 occupants, about 15 sustained non life-threatening injuries.
According to images at the accident location, the forward fuselage took massive damage from an unidentified object before it came to rest making it unlikely the aircraft will repaired again.
Unofficial reports indicate that when both engines spooled-up to 74 % thrust and the 737 began to accelerate, the right engine (CFM56-7B26) thrust reverser deployed forcing the aircraft along its vertical axis to the right. The pilots were unable to counteract and they immediately lost directional control.

Kaliningrad runway swept before A321 accident,"Kaliningrad Khrabrovo airport’s operator insists the condition of its runway was suitable to receive the Aeroflot Airbus A321 which subsequently veered off onto muddy ground and lost its nose-gear.
The airport operator states that the runway was cleaned and examined just 8min before the landing, which took place at 22:54 on 3 January.
It adds that the coefficient of friction was measured at 0.32 and that this was “valid” for the “difficult” weather conditions – which included snow showers and a crosswind.
“All the information was given to the [aircraft’s captain] to make a landing decision,” the operator says.
Within 40min of the accident, it adds, the coefficient of friction was measured again, and found to be 0.34.
Only minor injuries were sustained among the 167 passengers and seven crew members, but the aircraft – which came to rest 15-20m from the runway – suffered substantial damage.
Its nose-gear detached during the accident and the jet became stranded in soft ground, with its main landing-gear sunk in by 70%.
Khrabrovo airport’s operator says the combination of damage and the ground condition was “extremely unfavourable” for recovery of the jet, and it recruited specialised military equipment to assist with the task.
By 22:35 on 4 January the aircraft had been lifted onto a concrete surface and at 02:30 the following day it was towed to a parking stand, enabling the runway to be restored to an operational state by 06:00 on 5 January.",Incident

While the Teamsters Local 1224, which represents ABX pilots, and ATSG management are engaged in ongoing disputes over a new labor contract, it appears that the current strike is about a “return to the status quo,” and not to do with inking a new agreement. That “status quo,” the union argues, has been violated by excessive overtime requirements without the requisite time off.
According to Daniel Wells, who spoke on behalf of the union, pilots are denied days off under the “emergency assignment” designation, and compensatory days off are in turn denied for the same reason, effectively giving the pilots little to no control over their schedules. Wells noted that the approximately 250 pilots are collectively owed 7,000 compensatory days. He added that pilots that refuse can be disciplined or fired.

Pilots threaten worldwide strike,"Hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers face flight delays and cancellations after pilots threatened to strike over hijack fears.
The International Federation of Air Line Pilots Associations (IFALPA) has called a 24-hour stoppage and accused governments of failing to take action to halt air piracy.
British Air Line Pilots Association spokesman (BALPA), Gordon Hurley, said hijacking was on the increase, and striking was the ""only effective way of dealing with it"".
""Until governments take the matter seriously and make airports secure and stop this hijacking, this menace, this piracy, this is the only alternative we have,"" he said.",Incident
"Atlas, Southern and Polar pilots vote to authorise strike action","Pilots working for Atlas Air, Southern Air, Polar Air, ABX and Kalitta have voted in favour of authorising their unions to call strike action.
Nearly 2,000 pilots, representing 93% of union members, at the five US cargo carriers voted online through anonymous balloting in April and May, with 99% of voters giving the go-ahead to take strike action if necessary.
The vote to authorise strike action does not necessarily mean industrial action will take place, but can be seen as a useful agreement to have in place while negotiations are ongoing.
The Teamsters union claimed that the five carriers account for approximately 70% of DHL’s total flying worldwide, while it could also have an impact on Amazon, which will lease aircraft from ATSG and Atlas.
“This is truly an unprecedented situation where pilots across five different companies are standing up together to send a message that we refuse to be treated below industry standards,” said Captain Mike Griffith, an Atlas pilot.
“By calling this strike vote, we are telling our respective companies – and DHL – that they need to listen to the pilots who keep them flying and help build their millions in profits.”
In response, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, which owns or has stakes in Atlas, Southern and Polar, said the unions had no right to call a strike.
The dispute centres on ongoing negotiations between unions and airlines over new pilot contracts, with Atlas and Southern negotiations complicated by the merger of the two companies.",Incident
Threat of Strike by Hawaiian Pilots,"On the heels of the Lufthansa pilot strike is another threat of disruptions by the Hawaiian Airlines pilots. On December 5th there was a meeting between the investors and stock holders of Hawaiian Airlines and the ALPA, the union representing the pilots of Hawaiian Airlines.
This meeting occurred in New York City with representatives of the pilots union picketing the building where the meeting was being held. In the typical outdated strong arm tactics used by most unions today, the ALPA representative released to the press that due to a breakdown in negotiations, the threat of a strike during the upcoming holiday season was possible.
The union representing the pilots claims they have offered a contract to the airlines that feel is just, with competitive market wages. This contract includes an overall value increase of 50% to the pilots. The union also claims the contract offered by the airlines was insufficient because in the past year the airline was profitable. 99% of the pilots have already voted for a strike.",Incident
Korean Air says pilot strike suspended; resuming normal schedule,"Korean Air said strike action by its unionized pilots has been suspended, allowing it to resume a normal schedule. The SkyTeam global alliance carrier had been posting notice of cancelled flights through Jan. 10 in anticipation of strike action. An airline website statement issued Dec. 29 says some of those flights will still be affected as it works to resume normal operations.",Incident
Virgin Atlantic pilots to take industrial action over union recognition,"Virgin Atlantic pilots have voted to take industrial action short of a strike in a row over union recognition, and will work “strictly to contract” from 23 December.
Their union, the Professional Pilots’ Union (PPU), said 88% of its members voted in favour on a turnout of 80%.
The action will see a removal of “pilot goodwill”, with pilots who are members of the PPU working strictly to their contracts. “It is possible that this may leave some flights not covered for the duration of any action, which has the potential to continue indefinitely,” said a statement.
The PPU was launched three years ago, breaking away from the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), and it claims to represent 70% of Virgin’s 900 pilots.
It wants to be the only union Virgin deals with, and for Balpa to be derecognised. The PPU is formed entirely of Virgin Atlantic pilots and is not affiliated to the TUC.",Incident
Pilots call strike next week to demand change at Kenya Airways,"A major Kenyan pilots' union has called for an indefinite strike beginning Oct. 18 to protest what it described as poor management at the troubled national carrier Kenya Airways, the union's general secretary said on Tuesday. ""We have no confidence in the airline's recovery,"" said a circular from Capt. Paul Gichinga, the head of the Kenya Airline Pilots Association (KALPA). ""KALPA's members will from 5:00 a.m. (local time) Tuesday 18th of October down their tools until a comprehensive change of guard at Kenya Airways is effected."" 
No one from Kenya Airways was immediately available for comment.

Pilots' strike cause holiday chaos,"Holidaymakers flying to Spain had their travel plans disrupted today after pilots began a week-long strike in what experts fear marks the start of a summer of airline strife.
Spanish carrier Iberia had planned initially to cancel five flights between London and Spain - three to Madrid and two to Barcelona - at the start of a seven-day action that threatens around 1,500 of the airline's flights over the period.
But many more Iberia flights between Heathrow and Madrid and Barcelona are set to be axed, with the strike scheduled to carry on until Sunday.
It marks the fourth summer of industrial action at British airports amid fears that it could be just the first of a string of disputes- some potentially involving British Airways - affecting UK travellers.
The Iberia pilots are striking over fears of job losses and about 240 Iberia flights a day - though not all of them UK services - are likely to be cancelled during the seven-day industrial action.

22 hours to move Lufthansa plane stuck at Mumbai airport’s runway," took nearly 12 hours to mobilise staff to begin moving the Lufthansa aircraft that was stuck on the tarmac of Mumbai airport on Friday night. The aircraft was finally towed away 22 hours later.
The aircraft carrying 163 passengers from Munich got stuck on the tarmac around 10.50pm after its landing gear failed. It sat on the airport’s main runway till the next morning. Although flight ops were moved to the secondary runway, at least four flights, including the Lufthansa return flight to Munich, were cancelled. These included a flight each by Air India and United Airlines bound to Newark.
The Singapore Airlines Airbus 380 was also cancelled. All flights were running up to 40 minutes late and about 1,000 passengers bound to long distance international destinations were held up in the city.
According to airport sources, the German carrier approached Jet Airways for help around 7 am on Saturday. While airport officials did not comment on the delay, a Jet Airways spokesperson confirmed the airline’s engineers began the rescue work on Saturday morning.",Incident
Soft spot caused by the heat on the tarmac at Reagan Airport on Friday.,"Things were proceeding normally Friday evening as a US Airways flight was leaving the gate at Reagan National Airport to begin its flight to Charleston, S.C.
But the temperature reached 100 degrees in Washington on Friday and that apparently softened the airport paving enough to immobilize the airplane. The small vehicle that usually tows planes away from the gate tugged and pulled, but the plane was stuck.
“It was apparently a soft spot caused by the heat,” airline spokeswoman Michelle Mohr said, and the airplane “wouldn’t move.”
A jet airliner getting stuck in the airport tarmac appeared to be one of the more unusual incidents that occurred in the Washington area amid a blistering string of daily temperatures above 95 degrees.",Incident
Tyre burst on landing causes flight diversions to Mombasa,"A runway incident earlier this evening at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport has once again demonstrated the immediate need to have a second runway. East Africa’s busiest airport came to a standstill, once again, when an incoming Kenya Airways flight from Entebbe, KQ 415, burst its tyres on landing, leaving the aircraft stuck on the runway.
Passengers, none of them came to any harm, were disembarked from the aircraft and bussed to the arrivals terminal.
All incoming flights bound for Jomo Kenyatta International Airport subsequently, and at great expense to the affected airlines, had to be diverted to Mombasa while flight departures had to be delayed until the runway was eventually cleared after 9 p.m. and flights could resume. Affected passengers and people on the ground were advised to seek information from their airline as to landing of inbound flights and revised take off times for outbound flights.
The incident prompted immediate calls from the aviation fraternity at Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to give the building of the second runway top priority and see to it that it is completed at the earliest opportunity.
The second runway was part of the expansion of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport under the ‘Project Greenfield‘ which was launched with much fanfare by President Uhuru Kenyatta only to be scrapped a year and a bit later, leaving contractor and government locked in arguments over compensation while further delaying the construction of the crucially important second runway.",Incident
Passengers Stuck On Plane For 3 Hours Due To Snow,"An airplane got stuck on the runway for nearly three hours at Pittsburgh International Airport Wednesday night.
This was kind of the icing on the cake for some. A few passengers KDKA-TV’s Heather Abraham spoke to experienced 30 hours or more of delays at various airports from the storm.
Snow was still an issue Thursday morning at Pittsburgh International Airport with maintenance crews clearing the way for departing and arriving flights. According to airport officials, as the American Airlines plane was taxiing around 8:20 p.m., it hit a patch of snow, which stopped the plane in its tracks.
American Airlines said the captain decided to stop as a precaution with snow and ice buildup around the landing gear. It wasn’t until close to midnight that passengers were bused off the plane.",Incident
Trang Airport reopens after three-day closure due to stuck plane,"Trang Airport reopened Friday after a three-day closure caused by a Boeing 737 aircraft that became stuck in the mud near the runway.
Removing the aircraft took longer than expected because we didn't have the right equipment,"" Trang Airport director Thaworn Saengamphai told Thai TV PBS.
The airport, 600 kilometres south of Bangkok, was closed Tuesday evening after a Nok Air plane carrying 142 passengers and crews kidded off the runway during take-off in a heavy rainstorm. No one was injured in the incident.
The aircraft, whose wheels had sunk 70 centimetres into the mud, was removed Thursday night after Thai Airways International, the main shareholder in low-cost airline Nok Air, provided the airport with a crane and other equipment.",Incident
Kalibo airport operations suspended,"Operations at the Kalibo International Airport have been suspended since Monday morning after a passenger aircraft experienced a mishap that got stuck at the edge of a runway as it was taxiing for take-off.
No one was reported injured after a Tigerair plane bound for Singapore with 49 passengers malfunctioned around 8:30 a.m., according to a report of the Aklan Provincial Police Office.
Percy Malonesio, Kalibo airport manager, said the front and left rear tires of the plane got stuck at the edge of the runway while the aircraft was making a U-turn before takeoff.
Airport personnel had already dislodged one of the tires, according to Malonesio.
All incoming and outgoing flights remained suspended as of 1 p.m.
In a statement, Tigerair Philippines said “there is no cause for alarm as the aircraft will be towed back to the ramp for inspection and further release for flight.”
It said the passengers were billeted at hotel Esperanza for their next available flight out to Singapore.

Moving Southwest's Boeing 737 by crane called 'delicate' event,"A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737 was being moved from a passenger gate to a maintenance hangar shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday when it went off a taxiway and ended up nose-down in a grassy area, authorities said.
The jet's nose gear collapsed and an engine got stuck in the ground, according to the Federal Aviation Authority. That forced crews to use a crane to lift it back up.
Two mechanics were the only people on board during the taxiing and were not injured, according to a Southwest Airlines spokesperson.
Crews brought in the crane late Wednesday morning to remove it, in what Orlando International Airport spokeswoman Carolyn Fennell described as a ""delicate and slow process."" Runway 18 Right was closed while crews worked in that area, she said.
""Once the aircraft is removed, the runway will be swept and reopened,"" she said.
Three other runways stayed open, Fennell said. The closure did not affect airport operations, she noted.
The plane was moved from the taxiway and taken to the Southwest hangar by 2 p.m. It moved at a speed of roughly 2 miles per hour. Then Runway 18 Right was swept and reopened, bringing the airport back to four operational parallel runways.
The airport remained ""capable of handling three simultaneous operations throughout the incident,"" a statement from the airport said. In an email, Southwest Airlines said its ""number one priority is the safety of our customers and employees.""

More flights diverted to GenSan as aircraft remains stuck on runway in Davao,"ore flights to and from the Davao International Airport were diverted to the General Santos International Airport here on Tuesday as the runway in Davao has remained closed following an incident involving a Cebu Pacific aircraft on Sunday night.
Dante Fernandez, administrative officer of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) here, said Cebu Pacific and Philippine Airlines re-routed anew their scheduled flights for Tuesday at the Davao airport pending the  clearing of its runway.
Cebu Pacific failed to meet the deadline to remove the aircraft by 8 p.m. Monday.  It asked for an extension until 7 a.m. Tuesday but the aircraft remained stuck.  CAAP again gave Cebu Pacific until 3 p.m. and said it would take over the job of removing the aircraft if it fails to do so.
As of  5:30 p.m.  already under the supervision of CAAP,  the aircraft had moved by about 50 meters.
Capt. John Andrews, CAAP Deputy Director General told ABS CBN News Channel at 5:30 p.m. that they hope to clear the runway by 6 p.m.
The 6 p.m. deadline, however, may not be met because the tarmac of the old airport, where the aircraft would be towed, is still about 300 meters away.
“There’s no word yet as to when the runway will be finally cleared and reopened. Until now, its status remains inoperational,” Fernandez said in an interview over radio station Bombo Radyo.",Incident

The operation of international flights, which begin around 9 p.m., was likely to be affected by this incident, sources said. Afsal K. of Hyderabad said that his flight to Bangalore was delayed.",Incident
,"The Cebu Pacific plane that missed the runway at the Francisco Bangoy International Airport Sunday night, remained stuck at the edge of the runway Tuesday morning, prompting an incensed Davao Mayor Sarah Duterte to plan another visit to the  airport later Tuesday.
Duterte told reporters she wanted to find out when the managements of airport  and Cebu Pacific would actually tow the plane away as it has been causing flight cancellations since Sunday. Eighty flights have reportedly been canceled since Sunday night but this has not been officially confirmed.
All flights to and from the Davao City airport have been suspended because the stranded plane has rendered the runway unusable because of the hazard it poses to aircraft that might attempt any landing or takeoff.
As of  8:30 a.m. Tuesday, the airport management said it still had not found a way to clear the runway.

Amsterdam's Schiphol airport hit by major computer outage,"A major computer malfunction crippled traffic at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport for hours on Wednesday, causing delays or cancellations of more than 100 flights at one of Europe's largest transportation hubs.
The outage was cause by faulty hardware, the Netherlands' Air Traffic Control said in a statement issued seven hours after the first problem was reported. An initial reboot of computer systems in the morning had failed to resolve the issue.
""Air traffic is being restored to the normal situation"" after capacity had been severely cut back, the statement said. Passengers faced hours of delays as flights were diverted to alternative European airports including Munich and Rotterdam, a spokesman said. Schiphol ranks among Europe's most congested airports with 58 million passengers in 2015.

Travelers stranded at Atlanta airport after computer glitch,"There were long lines of passengers Monday at the international terminal at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
Channel 2's Steve Gehlbach saw a dozen or so passengers who were stuck at the airport Monday morning after a worldwide computer glitch at British Airways. He talked to some of the passengers who were desperate to make it to their destinations.
British Airways said the computer failure that caused problems worldwide is now fixed.
However a plane that should have left around 10 p.m. Monday was still grounded on Tuesday.
About 150 people made it onto the flight and they waited four hours inside the plane.
They got to the end of the runway, ready to take off, before the flight was canceled around 5 a.m. Tuesday.
The passengers were taken off the plane, collected their baggage and waited to get hotel rooms
""Then we got on the flight. Everything was hunky dory. OK, let's go. Then (we) got to the top of the runway (and they) said it was crew flying hours, so then we had to decamp the plane, but after meals and everything else given out to us, so not great,” Natalie Elliot said.

Major airport delays after computer reservation system crashes,"One of the world’s largest airline computer reservation systems suddenly failed Monday night, causing delays for passengers at Sea-Tac Airport and around the world. At 9:20 p.m. Alaska passengers were told there was no-way to check them in, and some passengers were told there could be delays getting their luggage on and off the flights.
“They gave me a sheet of paper explaining the computer crash”, said Nathan Mitchell, while waiting to check in for his flight to LAX. “But I can’t get answers at all. I heard the agents were getting people on the flights writing names on paper instead of the computer,” he said.
“Sabre” is a computer flight reservation technology used by Alaska, American, United, Jet Blue and nearly 300 other airlines worldwide. 46 minutes after the computer failure, the company released a message via twitter:
""Sabre is experiencing a system issue. Our technology team is working as quickly as possible to resolve the situation.""
Soon travellers were expressing frustration on social media from airports around the world. By 11:15, the computers started showing signs of life again at SeaTac and passengers were able to check-in after a delay lasting over two hours.
For Alaska passengers, the computer glitch was the second in two months causing delays. On June 28th an internal computer problem caused some flights to be delayed for two hours until the system could be rebooted.",Incident
United Airlines blames computer problems for grounding domestic flights,"Computer problems grounded all United Airlines domestic flights for more than two hours Sunday evening and airport operators, including those at Denver International Airport, urged travelers to check their arrangements.
United spokeswoman Maddie King confirmed Sunday night that flights were grounded after 4:30 p.m. “due to an IT issue” and that, after 7 p.m., flights resumed.
“Customers may experience additional delays as we work to get flights out this evening,” King said in an emailed response late Sunday. “We are issuing a system-wide waiver and apologize for the inconvenience to our customers.”

Flights disrupted after computer failure at UK control centre,"Passengers are facing widespread flight disruption after a computer failure at the UK's air traffic control centre.
National Air Traffic Services (Nats) said a technical fault in the flight data system at its Swanwick centre had caused the problem.
It had now been restored to ""full operational capacity"", the air traffic control company said.
The government said the disruption was ""unacceptable"" and demanded a ""full explanation"" of what had gone wrong. The glitch caused problems at airports around the country - including delays at Heathrow and Gatwick, where departing flights were grounded for a time. Other UK airports reported knock-on effects.
It comes a year after a telephone failure at the Hampshire control room caused huge disruption - one of a number of technical hitches to hit the part-privatised Nats since the centre opened in 2002.

Passengers Wait And Fume As Air Canada Computer Failure Hits Worldwide,"An Air Canada computer glitch, which caused major delays on flights around the world Friday, is now fixed. But slowdowns continued into the afternoon at the transit hub as the carrier worked to catch up with the significant backlog.
What was normally a busy time at the Toronto airport with back to back planes taking off was anything but starting from about 4:30am – runways were bare and jets were only leaving once every two to five minutes.
Most flights with the carrier were on standby and stuck at terminals on account of the issue. The problem had to do with the Air Canada’s inability to process passengers with their computer system. Agents weren’t able to print boarding cards or luggage tags and so were forced to check many people in manually.
“We have backups on the reservation system,” confirmed Air Canada spokesperson John Segaret. “Those things function properly on the network, but for whatever reason, we’ve not been able to get through, and I don’t know whether that was a fault of the network itself or the electronic components that back that up.”",Incident

Airplane off runway in Winnipeg,"Poor visibility Friday night resulted in a United Airlines flight losing its way after landing at Winnipeg's Richardson International Airport.
The plane, which had just arrived from Denver, was taxiing to the terminal building, but the crew couldn't see all the guiding lights in the blowing snow and turned off of the tarmac onto grass.
The CRJ700 plane has been stuck there all night.
No one was injured. The airport used a city bus to move the estimated 80 passengers to the terminal because the weather was too cold to ask people to walk.
A spokeswoman for the airport told CBC News on Saturday that the plane was still on the grass and that local crews were working to move it. It was expected the work would be done by early afternoon.
The airport has closed a runway, one of just two, which is causing some delays on scheduled flights. The airport updates details of flight delays at www.waa.ca
In a separate incident Friday evening, an Air Canada Jazz plane reported hitting a number of birds shortly after takeoff.

UK air traffic control failure identified,"An unprecedented computer systems failure set off the mayhem that caused delays and cancelled flights for thousands of passengers this weekend. 
In its first detailed explanation of the computer glitch that led to flight disruptions on Friday, National Air Traffic Services, which operates the UK’s main air traffic control centre at Swanwick, said the problems occurred as more workstations were being brought on line to deal with an increase in traffic.
“In normal operations the number of workstations in use versus in standby fluctuates with the demands of the traffic being controlled,” Nats said in a statement. “In this instance a transition between the two states caused a failure in the system which has not been seen before.” 
 The computer failure made it impossible for the controllers to access data regarding individual flight plans. Aircraft were prevented from taking off, but those in the air and close to airports were allowed to land during the shutdown that lasted about 35 minutes.
Air passengers faced continued disruption into the weekend even after Nats declared its systems were back to full operational capacity. A spokesman for Heathrow said 38 flights were cancelled before 9.30am on Saturday “as a knock on from yesterday”.",Incident

Airspace over London and the South East was closed for 36 minutes yesterday afternoon, leading to a backlog that could take until this afternoon to clear.
Mr McLoughlin said: “Any disruption to our aviation system is a matter of the utmost concern, especially at this time of year in the run up to the holiday season.

Delays to Hong Kong’s new air traffic control system could lead to more cancelled flights,"Hong Kong’s controversial new air traffic control system is set to plunge airlines and the city’s international airport into fresh chaos as the final commissioning to an upgraded flight radar system this weekend is set to be delayed, the Post can reveal.
Aviation authorities have confirmed a new navigation system, which has been several months in the planning, and was scheduled to go live this Sunday, faces technical issues just days before the new system goes live without backup.
In recent days, flight radar screens have frozen and malfunctioned on controllers. The Civil Aviation Department confirmed “isolated incidents” of display degradation but insisted flight safety was not affected.
The situation may become problematic after the regulator and Airport Authority had ordered a reduction of flights scheduled for a month lasting from October 30 to November 26 to accommodate the new operating system. Therefore, there is uncertainty as to whether a fresh delay could extend the reduction of flights, clipping the wings of airlines and stifling Hong Kong’s connectivity as an international aviation hub.

Air Route Traffic Control Center in Palmdale, Calif. The L.A. Center handles landings and departures at the region's major airports, including Los Angeles International (LAX), San Diego and Las Vegas.
The computers at the L.A. Center are programmed to keep commercial airliners and other aircraft from colliding with each other. The U-2 was flying at 60,000 feet, but the computers were attempting to keep it from colliding with planes that were actually miles beneath it.
Though the exact technical causes are not known, the spy plane's altitude and route apparently overloaded a computer system called ERAM, which generates display data for air-traffic controllers. Back-up computer systems also failed.",Incident
$2 billion air traffic control system failed by running out of computer memory,"It was a shortage of computer memory in the $2.4 billion air traffic control system while a U-2 spy plane flew over southwestern US that caused LAX computers to crash and hundreds of flights to be delayed on April 30. “In theory, the same vulnerability could have been used by an attacker in a deliberate shut-down,” security experts told Reuters. Now that the “very basic limitation of the system” is known, experts expressed concerns about aviation cyberattacks. Lockheed Martin, which created the En Route Automation Modernization (ERAM) air traffic control system, claims it conducts ""robust testing"" on all its systems, yet the lack of altitude information in the U-2’s flight plan caused the automated system to cycle off and on trying to fix the error. After an air traffic controller entered an estimated 60,000 feet as the U-2’s altitude, the system attempted to calculate all possible flight paths in order to ensure the U-2 wasn’t on a crash course with other aircraft at much lower altitudes. That process, according to the FAA, “used a large amount of available memory and interrupted the computer's other flight-processing functions.""
“The ERAM system failed because it limits how much data each plane can send it,” sources told Reuters. “Most planes have simple flight plans, so they do not exceed that limit.” The FAA now requires altitudes for every flight plan and also added memory to the ERAM system to prevent it from crashing in the future.

U.S. Flight Delays Linger After FAA Computer Failure,"U.S. travelers coped with late flights and cancellations on Sunday, one day after a now-resolved computer failure at a regional air-traffic control center disrupted operations from New York to Florida.
At least 2,250 U.S. flights were late on Sunday and more than 150 were canceled, according to FlightAware.com data. The airports with the most affected departures included those in Philadelphia and Washington, the flight-tracking website showed.
Travelers in some East Coast airports on Saturday were delayed more than three hours before the Federal Aviation Administration fixed the air-traffic control computer breakdown and ended flight restrictions late in the afternoon.
On Saturday, some 3,800 flights within, into or out of the U.S. were delayed and 650 were canceled, according to the website. A statement from the Federal Aviation Administration said 492 delays and 476 cancellations were attributable to the malfunction in a five-month-old system installed to help upgrade the agency’s operations in Leesburg, Virginia.
“FAA air traffic has operated normally today,” Laura Brown, a spokeswoman for the agency, said Sunday in a subsequent e-mailed statement. “The FAA is continuing to work with airlines that may still be repositioning airplanes and crew members.”
The FAA is focusing on a recent software upgrade at Leesburg as the culprit that triggered the shutdown, Brown said in the statement. The software for the system tracking high-altitude flights was returned to an earlier version and the technology appears to be functioning fine, the agency said.",Incident

EasyJet warned: “Every airline flying to and from Italy, as well as those flying within Italian airspace, will be affected.
“We are doing everything possible to minimise the impact to our customers and are working through our plans which we will communicate as soon as we can.
“If we are forced to cancel any flights, our customers will be informed by SMS and email, with up to date information on the situation available on easyJet,com.”",Incident
Air Traffic Controllers Reaffirm Nationwide Strike Action,"Unionized Italian aviation sector workers have reconfirmed a nationwide strike. The strike will include ENAV air traffic controllers (ATCs) and TechnoSky personnel, and could lead to the cancellation of hundreds of flights. Levels of disruption could vary by time and location, depending on how effectively transport officials mitigate staff shortages. Airlines often alter flight schedules - rescheduling flights earlier or later - to avoid operating during the strike period. Lingering disruptions may continue after the strike ends as airlines reposition aircraft and process passenger and freight backlogs. Although the strikes have the potential to result in air transport disruptions, they will probably not be crippling, as Italian law requires that transport workers maintain a minimum level of service during labor actions.",Incident
Italian air traffic control strike disrupts UK flights,"UK travellers are among the air passengers facing major disruption due to a strike by Italian air traffic controllers.
The four-hour stoppage is running between 11:30 and 15:30 BST.
Ryanair said it had cancelled 96 flights, while Easyjet said around 60 would be affected - including 20 flights into and out of the UK.
British Airways said it had re-scheduled some flights but was seeking to minimise disruption.
Ryanair's cancelled flights include seven into and out of the UK, among them Manchester to Bologna, London Stansted to Ancona and Trieste, and Liverpool to Pisa.
Head of communications for the airline, Robin Kiely, said: ""We sincerely apologise to all passengers who have had their travel plans disrupted by these unjustified ATC strikes.""",Incident
Air traffic controllers threaten strike action,"Air traffic controllers have raised the prospect of strike action over Government proposals to privatise the service.
Delegates at a conference of the controllers' union, The Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists, proposed to vote for industrial action if ministers refused to consider alternatives.
Speaking from the conference in Stockport, Greater Manchester, Iain Findlay, national officer for the IPMS, said the vote was to protest against Government proposals to sell off 51% of National Air Traffic Services.
The IPMS has campaigned hard against the planned public-private partnership for NATS.
'We have given the Government a not-for-profit alternative but they haven't taken that opportunity up,' Mr Findlay said earlier.
On Wednesday, the Government confirmed that bids from the three groups invited to submit final offers for a stake in National Air Traffic Services (NATS) had been received.
According to the plans, the scheme would give a 46% stake to a strategic private sector partner, with 5% allocated to NATS staff and a 49% share kept by the Government.
Bidders have put forward offers to be involved in the partial privatisation of air traffic services despite controversy among MPs and unions.

Airlines repeat call for ATC strike ban,"Airlines have renewed their campaign to urge the French Government and the European Commission to ban strike action by air traffic controllers in light of a five-day walk-out this week.
ATC workers at some French airports have confirmed a strike which is set to impact flights to and from France and to other destinations reached via French airspace.
Around 1000 flights are expected to be cancelled and many other services delayed due to the action planned from today (Monday).
""Already during the first weeks of 2017 European travellers become victims of yet another ATC strike - unbelievably, not only for a day but for a whole week,"" said Thomas Reynaert, managing director of European airline lobbying group A4E.
""We cannot allow a small group of Europe's 15,000 air traffic controllers restricting the rights of millions of European travellers. Following our Call for Action last year we have seen a positive reaction by some unions. It is now the right moment to build on that and minimise the impact of strike actions without questioning the individual right of workers to take industrial action.""

",Incident
Reagan Starts Firing Air Traffic Controllers,"US President Ronald Reagan began firing 11,359 air traffic controllers who were striking in violation of an order for them to return to work, on 5th August, 1981.
The event is regarded as a landmark example of the strict domestic and economic policies of Reagan’s administration. From his election campaign onward, Reagan had promised reductions in government spending, reductions in capital gains and incomes tax, reductions in government regulation, and reductions in inflation through strict controls on the money supply.
Associated with these economic policies, and crucial for their successful implementation, was a domestic policy which took a firm position on trade unionism and strike action. Coming early in Reagan’s first term as President of the United States, the air traffic controllers strike was an opportunity to make an important statement about his stance on unionisation.
13,000 Air-traffic controllers in the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Association (PATCO) had gone on strike on 3rd August, 1981, after negotiations with the federal government had failed to secure the pay rise and shortened work week they had demanded.
The mass strike was extensive enough to almost cripple air travel in the United States, grounding 7,000 flights and leaving passengers stranded. With millions of Americans badly affected by the flight cancellations, Reagan ordered the air-traffic controllers to return to work within 48 hours or lose their jobs.

",Incident
American air-traffic controllers strike for benefits and pay,"Members of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO), a United States trade union, staged a walkout and strike. The union intended the strike to address four main concerns:
Rank and filers maintained that their work was seriously undervalued and under-rewarded
That their work week was unreasonably long, especially in comparison to the hour worked by their overseas counterparts
That the FAA’s approach to supervision and to union-management relations undermined morale and the safety of the system
And that the FAA neglected serious deficiencies in staffing levels and hardware reliability.
However, in a move to focus on solely economic goals rather than a revamped work culture or genuine self-management, PATCO President Robert Poli demanded a wage increase of $10,000 a year for controllers, a reduced 32-hour four-day workweek, and a better benefits package for retirement. Controllers maintained that their demands deserved consideration, and pointed to the highly stressful nature of their job as proof. They also believed that they held the upper hand; since if they were not on the job, airplanes would have a hard time flying passengers and goods anywhere.",Incident
Grounded by indiscipline,"For perhaps the first time in aviation history, no aircraft - international or domestic - flew over Indian air space for close to 30 hours.
The reason: a wildcat strike by air traffic controllers (ATCOs) agitating against the suspension of a colleague who was held responsible for a near-collision over Palam airport in Delhi on April 2.
The strike resulted in the cancellation or rescheduling of more than 250 flights, leading to chaos in airports all over the country.
The letter suspending Ahmedabad-based ATCO S.S. Singh - temporarily posted in Delhi to initiate other controllers to new equipment - was issued on April 8.
For the Airports Authority of India (AAI), matters soon got out of hand as the ATCOs' guild was holding a national two-day meeting in Delhi on April 10. When news of the suspension reached the guild members on April 11, they immediately decided to strike work.
Since the guild gave no written intimation, the AAI was taken by surprise and, by evening, the suspension had been revoked. However, angry ATCO guild members delayed calling off the strike, claiming that international guidelines had been flouted.

Air strike: Traffic control officers ground flights nationwide,"International and domestic air traffic in the country was completely paralysed on Friday, April 11, and airports were unable to cope with the chaos of stranded passengers as air traffic controllers went on a flash strike to protest the suspension of a colleague.
Airports Authority of India Chairman Ranjan Chatterjee said tonight that the suspension of Deputy Director S S Singh had been revoked and this had been conveyed to the Air Traffic Controllers' Guild.
However, the controllers continued their stir.
Air Traffic Controllers' Guild Regional President (Bombay) I J Mukherjee, however, told Rediff On The Net that the ATC officials are not on strike. ""We are putting on record our resentment at the AAI's hig-handedness - they suspended our deputy director against all International Civil Aviation Organisation norms. But our officials are on the channels and are providing services to all incoming flights. All flights in air will be brought down safely. So would any in emergencies.""

Plane crashes on to road in Italy after overshooting Bergamo airport runway,"A cargo plane has overshot the runway at Bergamo’s Orio al Serio international airport and crashed into a road.
The airport in Italy’s Lombardy region was temporarily closed after the incident which happened at 4am Friday morning.
Dramatic pictures showed a 737-400 aircraft belonging to courier firm DHL wedged onto a road at the end of the runway. The plane had landed at 4.07am after a flight from Paris Charles De Gaulle. No one was reported to have been hurt in the crash with the crew escaping unharmed. The paper carried a statement from Sacbo, the company that runs the airport saying the airport of Bergamo was back operating at 6.47 am.

Emirates Boeing 777 Explodes on Dubai Runway After Crash Landing,"An Emirates Boeing 777 with 300 people on board crash landed at Dubai International Airport Wednesday, skidding along a runway and erupting into an intense fire — but the airline said all onboard survived.
An engine was torn from the right wing of the plane as it scraped to a halt, forcing passengers and crew to evacuate before the aircraft was gutted by fire. Flights were halted at the airport — the busiest in the Middle East — as black smoke billowed from the wreckage.
Eyewitness Osama Alghamdi, a 23-year-old student, told NBC News that he saw a ""huge, huge fire"" and then ""two explosions"" while heading to his gate for a flight to Glasgow, Scotland.
""Everything took about 30 to 35 minutes,"" he added. ""It was so scary.""
Despite the scale of the fire and the speed at which it engulfed the jet, the evacuation of 282 passengers and 18 crew through inflatable slides appeared to have been successful.
The airline's chairman and CEO, Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, said in a recorded message that ""all passengers and crew are accounted for and safe.""",Incident
Baggage Workers Strike at Denver,"Workers who operate United Airlines’ baggage system at Denver International Airport went on strike today after rejecting a contract offer.
About 25 union members set up a picket line early this morning at one of the airport’s remote overflow parking lots. The remote location of the lot means other union workers will not have to cross picket lines to come to work.
Negotiations between the workers and Phelps Program Management, a subcontractor for United, broke down Monday night. The impasse centered on work conditions, wages and benefits.
It was not clear what effect the walkout would have on United. The airline issued a statement saying it planned normal operations but urged passengers to call before leaving for the airport.

Holidaymakers may be hit by KLM strikes at Schiphol,"Travellers are expected to face delays on Wednesday night as KLM baggage handlers at Schiphol airport are poised to go on strike. Strike action will take place between 7.30pm and 9pm and dozens of flights will be affected.
KLM is fighting the decision in court this afternoon. KLM ground crew want a 1% pay rise, more fixed contracts for temporary workers and no cutbacks to holidays and the number of so-called ‘senior days’ for people over 50. Negotiations between KLM and FNV ground to a halt last week on with KLM’s refusal to undo measures to cut back on ground personnel costs.

"PIA B772 near Lahore, wheels got stuck on runway","A PIA Pakistan International Airlines Boeing 777-200, registration AP-BGK performing flight PK-758 (dep Dec 30th) from London Heathrow,EN (UK) to Lahore (Pakistan), landed safely on runway 36L but was unable to vacate the runway.
Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority reported wheels were jammed while the aircraft was taxiing.
The airline reported hydraulic problems.
The Aviation Herald learned however, that there was no fault of the aircraft involved. After landing the crew was instructed to taxi to the very end of the runway rather than vacate via the last taxiway and to backtrack the runway. While attempting to turn around the uneven runway surface wasn't able to support the main wheels, the crew felt unusually high power settings were needed and stopped. An axle became unsettled and the wheels became stuck on the runway. The use of runway 36L for landing is unusual, but was made necessary due to the blockage of runway 36R.

"Aircraft in mud, runway still stuck","With the Turkish Airlines aircraft that skidded off the runway on Friday still stuck in mud, the main runway of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport remained closed for operations for the third day on Sunday. Salvage operations are on and a pavement has been built to help move the aircraft out of the slush, said a spokesperson for the Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL). Though the secondary runway is currently being used for flight operations, the spokesperson said most flights were on time on Sunday.
Speaking about the Turkish Airbus 340-300, the spokesperson said operations to remove it from the slush were on and they expected the aircraft to be moved by late Sunday night. ""The process of recovery of the Turkish Airlines aircraft is in progress. MIAL has deployed all resources and completed the construction of the pavement to remove the aircraft from the spot. The next steps are subject to an assessment of suitability of ground and weather conditions,"" said MIAL spokesperson Anindita Sinha.
However, even after the aircraft is towed away, the runway cannot be opened immediately. ""We will first inspect the runway. Only after our inspection will the runway be operational,"" said the spokesperson.
Sources said the on-time performance of flights would be affected through the week. ""There is a chance of flights getting delayed this week. The aircraft being stuck on the runway is just one of the many reasons. The weather has also been hostile as it has been raining heavily for the past few days,"" said a MIAL source.",Incident
BA jet stuck in Antigua after sinking into runway,"Hundreds of passengers were stranded in the Caribbean after a British Airways jet became stuck in newly laid asphalt at Antigua airport.
The Boeing 777, which left Gatwick on Wednesday with 140 passengers on board, was turning left from the taxi-way on to the main runway in preparation for take-off for the 45-minute flight to its final destination of St Lucia when the wheels under the right-hand wing sank more than six inches into the soft surface.
A British Airways spokesman said: ""The pilot had the choice of trying to accelerate out of the hole, and possibly digging it in deeper, or calling for assistance to get the plane out. He chose the latter, but initially they could find nothing on the island that was capable of pulling the 250-tonne aircraft free.""",Incident

"Windows 3.1 Is Still Alive, And It Just Killed a French Airport","A computer glitch that brought the Paris airport of Orly to a standstill Saturday has been traced back to the airport's ""prehistoric"" operating system. In an article published Wednesday, French satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaîné (which often writes serious stories, such as this one) said the computer failure had affected a system known as DECOR, which is used by air traffic controllers to communicate weather information to pilots. Pilots rely on the system when weather conditions are poor.
DECOR, which is used in takeoff and landings, runs on Windows 3.1, an operating system that came onto the market in 1992. Hardly state-of-the-art technology. One of the highlights of Windows 3.1 when it came out was the inclusion of Minesweeper — a single-player video game that was responsible for wasting hours of PC owners' time in the early '90s. DECOR's breakdown on Saturday prevented air traffic controllers from providing pilots with Runway Visual Range, or RVR, information — a value that determines the distance a pilot can see down the runway. As fog descended onto the runway and engineers battled to find the origin of the glitch, flights were grounded as a precaution.
""The tools used by Aéroports de Paris controllers run on four different operating systems, that are all between 10 and 20 years old,"" explained Alexandre Fiacre, the secretary general of France's UNSA-IESSA air traffic controller union. ADP is the company that runs both Orly and Paris' other airport, Charles de Gaulle, one of the busiest in the world.  ",Incident
"Router at root of Southwest Airlines’ computer systems outage; delays, cancellations persist","A router failure caused Southwest Airlines’ system to crash on Wednesday, and all backups failed, causing flight delays and cancellations nationwide and costing the company probably $10 million in lost bookings alone.
That assessment came from Gary Kelly, CEO of Dallas-based Southwest (NYSE: LUV), who commented on the cause and effect of the outage during an earnings call on Thursday.
“We have significant redundancies built into our mission critical systems, and those redundancies did not work, Kelly said. “We need to understand what happened and make sure that doesn’t happen again. Things will break, but we need to make sure that doesn’t happen again.”
Kelly said the massive computer systems failure was by far the worst in Southwest Airlines’ history. The company tried for hours to fix it, but ultimately “had to go back to the bedrock and reboot everything,” Kelly said.
He said today’s priority is to get the operation completely back up and running and get passengers where they need to go, as well as restoring customers’ ability to go online and buy tickets.
It’s too soon to assess the total cost, but just the inability to take bookings Wednesday will cost the airline $5 million to $10 million, Kelly said. That doesn’t include vouchers, overtime costs, technology fixes and other costs.",Incident
Computer Failure Leaves Long Lines At JFK,"A computer systems failure at JFK Airport in New York has left hundreds of international passengers stranded in the terminal.

Plane Damages Runway While Landing at LaGuardia,"A plane landing at LaGuardia Airport blew out a chunk of concrete on the runway as it was coming down, and flights were backed up for over an hour as crews repaired the runway, airport sources say.
Runway 31 was closed as workers repaved the hole, about 8 feet by 2 feet, officials said.
That left just one runway open at the airport, creating a bottleneck of flights trying to get in and out through the afternoon and evening. Departing flights were delayed over an hour, and ariving flights were delayed about a half-hour. 
The runway was repaired and reopened by 8:30 p.m. 
Neal Buccino, a spokesman for Port Authority, which oversees the three New York City-area airports, said a pilot on a departing flight noticed the damage shortly after 3 p.m. and reported it. 
Air traffic recordings captured the pilot's report to the controller: ""There's a bunch of debris on the runway, just off the right side of the aircraft,"" the pilot is heard saying. ""It looks like a piece of concrete off the number three on the runway, the number completely blown off.""

"37 dead and nearly 1,900 sickened by e-cigarettes, CDC says","Thirty-seven Americans have died from severe lung illnesses linked to e-cigarettes, new figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveal.

According to the report, released on Thursday, 1,888 people have developed EVALI (e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung illness) in every state but Alaska.

Most of the victims are male and under the age of 35, with ages of those who died ranging from 17 to 75.

There have been three deaths each confirmed in California, Georgia, Indiana and Minnesota and two deaths each in Illinois, Kansas, Oregon and Tennessee.

Meanwhile, one death each has been confirmed in Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington, DC.

Officials from the CDC, US Food and Drug Administration and state health departments are still racing to identify what exactly about e-cigarettes is making people deathly ill but, as most victims have reported using THC vapes, experts have warned against using these products.

Health officials have homed their investigation in on products that contain THC, the main psychoactive component in marijuana.

About 86 percent of people who've fallen ill have reported using THC pods, but experts say they cannot yet rule out nicotine as a cause of the spate of illnesses.

Of those who've fallen ill, 11 percent have reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products.

Officials add that teens and young people make up the majority of illnesses because flavored e-cigarettes were marketed towards them.

Amid pressure, e-cigarette company JUUL announced last week it will no longer sell flavored pods like creme brulee, cucumber, mango, mint and fruit anywhere.

Meanwhile, New York, Michigan, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah and Washington have enacted temporary bans on flavored e-cigarette products.

Massachusetts outdid them all and has enacted a ban all vaping products, flavored or non-flavored.

Many of these bans are facing legal challenges from vape shop owners who say the bans will ruin their businesses.

On the federal level, President Trump said his administration wanted to pull flavored e-cigarettes from the market nationwide.

But then the President seemed to curb his previous statement, instead tweeting that counterfeits need to be removed from the market.

Counterfeit or bootleg e-cigarettes that officials believe have been adulterated to contain THC have become the prime suspects in the search for the culprit of this year's vaping illness epidemic.

Recent analysis of the lung tissue of people with EVALI suggested that toxic chemicals released when e-liquids are heated may be damaging lungs.

Others have theorized that oils, including the glycerin base used in many vaping products or vitamin E acetate may be triggering inflammation and injury.

In the meantime, officials say that people using nicotine e-cigarettes as quit aids should not go back to smoking combustible cigarette, but are particularly warning young people and pregnant women against vaping.",Not Incident
Trump Accused Of ‚ÄòBribery‚Äô After Urging Donors To Support Senators Defending Him Against Impeachment,"Share to  to linkedin
			
		
	




	Trump's reelection campaign has been urging donors to contribute to a pot that will be split between ... [+] him and three other senators that have signed a resolution condemning impeachment proceedings against him
AFP via Getty ImagesTopline: President Donald Trump‚Äîwho is facing a formal impeachment inquiry in the House‚Äîhas leveraged his fundraising network to boost the campaigns of struggling Republican senators who have signed a resolution condemning impeachment proceedings, in a move that one former White House lawyer has suggested is ‚Äúfelony bribery.‚Äù
Politico reported that on Wednesday, Trump‚Äôs reelection campaign contacted its long email list of donors to ask for contribution that would be divvied up between him and senators Cory Gardner, Joni Ernst, and Tom Tillis.
The message, on Republican fundraising platform Winred, reads: ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt post strong fundraising numbers, we won‚Äôt be able to defend the president from the baseless Impeachment WITCH HUNT!‚Äù
Trump is also set to attend and support fundraising events for Republican senators seeking reelection, including a fundraising lunch for Senator David Perdue in Atlanta next week, at which those attending are asked to donate up to $100,000, according to Politico.
Some 36 senators, including Perdue, Lindsay Graham and Mitch McConnell, signed the resolution, which can be read here.

Chief critic: Richard Painter, who served as George Bush‚Äôs top ethics lawyer, accused Trump of bribery. He tweeted, along with a link to the Politico story: ‚ÄúAny other American who offered cash to the jury before a trial would go to prison for felony bribery. But he can get away with it? Criminal.‚Äù

Key background: Senators facing tough reelection bids‚Äîand lagging funds‚Äîare looking to Trump, whose 2020 campaign has raised $308 million so far this year, for help to boost their fortunes. Trump has been calling on those in his party to put up a united front against impeachment efforts, telling his cabinet earlier this month that Republicans should ‚Äúget tougher and fight.‚Äù Using the Democrats and outspoken Republican critic Mitt Romney as an example, he added: ‚Äú[The Democrats] don‚Äôt have Mitt Romney in their midst. They don‚Äôt have people like that. They stick together. You never see them break off.‚Äù
Tangent: Lawmakers in the House have passed a resolution to proceed with the impeachment inquiry against Trump, meaning it will now progress to public hearings.

Newtown Woman Goes Off on Beto and His Gun Control Proposals: 'The Democrats Have Failed!',"Warning: Video contains graphic language. 
Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke was heckled by a woman on Wednesday in Newtown, Conn. during an event with pro-gun control groups. Newtown is where the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School occurred.
The woman, Rebecca Carnes, said O'Rourke's gun control proposals are targeting good people and ignoring the true problem; mental health.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre here to hijack this town and to try to make an issue out of getting guns out of good peoples‚Äô hands that can make a difference and you that Beto,‚Äù Carnes shouted. ""No, this is bulls**t. It's about mental health and it's about this war on boys and masculinity.""
Some in attendance at the event tried to get Carnes to stop, but she kept shouting at O'Rourke, She repeatedly told the candidate to debate her.
""You're bulls**t by being here. Shame on you Beto,"" she continued. ""What do you have to say about urban violence? You don't care. The Democrats have been in charge of urban communities and cities for decades. The Democrats have failed! They don't care about you, sir.""
When people tried to get her removed from the gathering, Carnes objected, saying she is a third-generation member of the town.
O'Rourke has made strict gun control the focal point of his struggling presidential campaign. He has stuck to his guns on wanting to have mandatory compensated confiscation of AR-15s and AK-47s.
 
‚ÄúAnyone who does not and is caught in possession or seen in possession of one of these weapons of war, one of these instruments of terror, that weapon will be taken from them and they will be fined. And if they should persist in continuing to ‚Äî to use and to buy these weapons then there will be other consequences in the criminal code,"" O'Rourke recently said.

Ari Fleischer Explains Why Biden Is the 'Wrongest' Person to Be Commenting on Al-Baghdadi Raid,"Former Vice President Joe Biden questioned whether or not President Trump should be taking credit for the successful raid against ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. U.S. special forces raided his compound, before the monster ran into a tunnel and blew up himself and his three children. According to Biden, the mission was successful ""despite"" Trump and his ""ineptitude."" 
Former Bush Press Secretary Ari Fleischer told Biden why he had no right to offer any opinion on the matter. Quoting Marc Thiessen in the Washington Post, Fleischer reminded the presidential candidate that it was despite his efforts that the military under President Obama captured Osama Bin Laden in 2011. 
Biden, however, is ""weak on these issues."" 
In his WaPo piece, Thiessen recalls how Biden was one of only two ""no"" votes, the other being then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates, to advise President Obama not to give the green light for Operation Neptune Spear. He was reportedly worried about Obama's re-election.
So, Thiessen wonders, where does he get off criticizing Trump?
Yet, rather than praise Trump for ordering the killing of Baghdadi, Biden blasted the president, declaring the raid succeeded ‚Äúdespite his ineptitude as commander in chief.‚Äù The man who opposed the bin Laden operation criticizes the man who approved the Baghdadi operation? That‚Äôs rich. And it was the Obama-Biden administration‚Äôs withdrawal from Iraq in 2011 that allowed the Islamic State to rise from the ashes of defeat and build a caliphate the size of Britain. Talk about ineptitude.  (Washington Post)
Trump has every right to claim credit for the al-Baghdadi operation, Fleischer concluded.
 
""The president deserves the credit he gets as commander in chief for authorizing the raid,"" Fleischer said. ""The military carried it out.""
More details have emerged about the successful raid, including how Conan the hero dog helped corner the terror leader. On Wednesday the Pentagon released some astounding surveillance footage of the operation.",Not Incident
The Hurtt Locker: An Introduction,"The Hurtt Locker is a biweekly opinion column. The views expressed are solely the author‚Äôs.

Welcome, neighbor! My name is Matthew Hurtt, and you‚Äôve stumbled upon Hurtt Locker, a biweekly column about fiscal responsibility and good governance in Arlington. I‚Äôm grateful to the ARLnow team for giving me some space here to have this conversation with you.

Arlington is a vibrant and thriving community with a rich history of civic engagement, where decisions are debated and discussed at the neighborhood level. From time to time, however, county leaders appear to make decisions before seeking community input; and the process looks more like a formality rather than a genuine effort to engage the wide array of interest groups that exist and organize here.

If we are to pursue the ‚ÄúArlington Way,‚Äù we must continue to engage interest groups, neighborhoods, and individuals in robust conversation about the issues that impact our lives ‚Äì from traffic and infrastructure to education to financial incentives that attract businesses and jobs to Arlington.

I hope to explore these issues with you, neighbor, in a thought-provoking way. And I will draw on my community experience and engagement at the local level. Over the past several years, I have been at the table to discuss short-term rental regulations, food truck restrictions, and most recently, e-scooter and dockless bike regulations. In each of these conversations, I have pushed to break down barriers, encouraging county leaders to empower citizens to embrace expanded opportunity and prosperity.

And when it comes to budgeting for our future, I hope to reinvigorate the conversation around bond issues ‚Äî questioning the trend by county leaders of lumping ‚Äúmust have‚Äù projects with premium projects. Voters should have a clear choice when it comes to funding necessary projects over vanity projects.

Perhaps most importantly, I want to connect with you and find opportunities to collaborate and converse about these important issues. Beyond this column, I hope you will engage with me in person and at community events, or on social media. I strongly believe that cross-partisan discourse is possible here in Arlington. Let‚Äôs lead the way.

Matthew Hurtt is a 10-year Arlington resident who is passionate about localism and government transparency and accountability. Hurtt is a member of the Arlington Heights Civic Association and was previously the chairman of the Arlington Falls Church Young Republicans. Hurtt prides himself on his ability to bring people of diverse perspectives together to break down barriers that stand in the way of people realizing their potential.

State temporarily suspends controversial work requirement for Healthy Indiana Plan,"CLOSE





    Indiana's version of Medicaid, the Healthy Indiana Plan, offers much more than just access to lower-cost health insurance. It also can provide help in finding a job, housing, and transportation as well as a free cellphone and access to educational services.
    Wochit



In the face of a federal lawsuit challenging the state‚Äôs Medicaid work requirement, the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration will not suspend anyone‚Äôs benefits as the case makes its way through the courts.
Under the original plan, which had a phased rollout, people on the Healthy Indiana Plan, the state's alternative to Medicaid, could have been kicked off as early as January for failing to meet the work requirements.
FSSA officials said in a news release Thursday, however, that the agency will wait until the resolution of the lawsuit, which alleges that the work requirements violate the federal law that established the Medicaid program.
Filed last month on behalf of four Indiana residents, the lawsuit alleges that the new reporting requirement is cumbersome for those on Medicaid and could result in bureaucratic errors that result in beneficiaries losing coverage through no fault of their own.

Detractors often cite the cases of other states that imposed work requirements and caused thousands of people to lose coverage.
The lawsuit alleges that as many as 24,000 Indiana residents could find themselves without health care due to the work requirements.
But FSSA officials have argued that Indiana has taken a different approach than some of the other states. 
Part of that approach has been the state‚Äôs Gateway to Work program, which aims to prod people on Medicaid to seek education or job training, look for employment or find other outlets that meet the work requirement, such as volunteering.
The Gateway to Work program will continue, FSSA officials said.
‚ÄúWe remain committed to operating the Gateway to Work program and to continuing to build on the early successes of the program, through which HIP members are reporting successful engagements in their workplaces, schools and communities,‚Äù Indiana Medicaid Director Allison Taylor said in a statement.
If the legal challenge to the Medicaid work requirement eventually fails, FSSA said it would give HIP members who would be affected ‚Äúsubstantial advance notice‚Äù before putting it into place.
It is unclear how a successful legal challenge would affect the state‚Äôs approach to Medicaid expansion.

Altria Earnings: MO Stock Drops 2% Despite Q3 Beat,"Altria (NYSE:MO) earnings for the tobacco company‚Äôs third quarter of 2019 have MO stock falling on Thursday. This is despite its adjusted EPS of $1.19, which beats out Wall Street‚Äôs estimate of $1.15. Revenue of $6.86 billion also easily comes in above analysts‚Äô estimates of $5.34 billion for the quarter, but MO stock is still falling.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the Altria earnings report for Q3 2019.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter is up 10.20% from $1.08 in the same period of the year prior.

Revenue is largely unchanged YoY from $6.84 billion.

Operating income of $2.94 billion is 15.10% better than $2.56 billion in the third quarter of 2018.

The Altria earnings report also includes a change from net income in Q3 2018 to a net loss for the current quarter.

It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that MO saw a non-cash pre-tax impairment charge of $4.5 billion during the quarter.

This is from its investment in JUUL.


Howard Willard, Chairman and CEO of Altria, says this about the most recent MO stock earnings.

‚ÄúWe continue to believe the evolution of the tobacco industry represents a significant opportunity for Altria. We marked major milestones in our transformation journey this year, including launching IQOS and completing the on! transaction. We believe that, with current adult smoker trends and e-vapor disruption, it‚Äôs an opportune time to expand the availability of these options.‚Äù


The current Altria earnings report reveals that the company continues to expect adjusted per-share earnings between $4.19 and $4.27 for 2019. The low end of that guidance matches Wall Street‚Äôs estimate for the year.

MO stock was down 2.13% as of Thursday afternoon.

AMD Stock Still Looks Expensive,"After a nearly doubling this year, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock appears to be running out of gas.

The company‚Äôs latest earnings report failed to wow Wall Street. Net income at the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company rose to $120 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with $102 million, or 9 cents, a year ago, in GAAP earnings. Revenue at AMD rose 9% to $1.8 billion. The adjusted per-share profit was 18 cents. On that basis, analysts expected AMD to report a per-share profit of 18 cents on revenue of $1.81 million.

While AMD reported its highest quarterly sales since 2005 thanks to strong sales of its 7nm Ryzen processors, Radeon graphics chips and EPYC server chips, the company also issued its second straight disappointing guidance.

Disappointing Wall Street Yet Again

Of course, ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù is in the eye of the beholder. AMD‚Äôs revenue projection for the current quarter is between $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion, roughly a 48% increase. Wall Street‚Äôs expectations were for $2.15 billion. The stock sold off in after-hours trading before rebounding.


Gains in AMD‚Äôs Computing and Graphics division continued to offset weaknesses in the company‚Äôs Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom business in its latest quarter.

Microsoft‚Äôs decision to phase out support for Windows 7 is giving the moribund PC market a boost, which is good news for AMD‚Äôs Computing and Graphics business and its rivals. The unit‚Äôs sales jumped 36% to $1.28 billion, its best performance since 2011. Operating income rose nearly 80% to $179 million. 

Keep in mind, though, that the PC market continues to have its challenges. Data from Gartner estimates that worldwide shipments gained 1.1% on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter. The U.S. posted a 0.3% decline as gains in desktop PCs couldn‚Äôt overcome a third consecutive quarter of declines for mobile PCs.

AMD‚Äôs Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom business continue to underperform because of soft demand for game consoles like the Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Xbox and Sony (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation. Revenue slumped 27% year-over-year to $525 million. Operating income fell to $61 million as operating expenses rose. 



Click to Enlarge AMD expects better times ahead for the division as new gaming consoles arrive for the holiday season.  I am not sure whether any of these devices will be ‚Äúgame-changers‚Äù ‚Äî excuse the pun. Market research from Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence expects the console market to have a compound annual growth rate of about 4% for the next few years.

AMD Stock Is No Bargain

Shares of AMD have skyrocketed more than 1,000% over the past five as the chipmaker emerged from the shadow of its much larger rival Intel, which gained 66 percent during that same period.

About the only reason to buy AMD stock is as a 5G play. As my colleague Will Healy noted last year, the company will benefit from the growing numbers of data centers that will need to be located near cell towers. Even so, whatever good news associated with AMD stock is already reflected in its lofty valuation.

With a trailing price-to-earnings multiple topping 179, AMD trades at a premium to rivals, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) (13.1), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)  (45.2) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) (21.9). The average 52-week price target for AMD stock is $34.59, about where it currently trades. AMD stock is going to tread water for the foreseeable future and should be avoided unless there is a significant price drop.

Emilia Clarke reveals who left coffee cup in 'Game of Thrones' scene,"The end of Game of Thrones answered a lot of burning questions fans had, but until now, one thing still remained a mystery: Who left that coffee cup in a scene? Emilia Clarke finally laid all conspiracy theories to rest when she revealed the culprit in an interview with Jimmy Fallon. 
Eagle-eyed fans spotted the beverage that started ""coffee-gate"" in the fourth episode of the show's final season. The cup appeared about 20 minutes into the episode, while characters in Winterfell were enjoying a feast. While Tormund and Jon Snow are talking, Danaerys is seen brooding in the background with a to-go cup of coffee. 
      
    
        
    

    

The internet lost its mind after the cup was spotted. Dozens of memes were made, and HBO even deleted the fourth episode from its site and replaced it with a new version where the cup had been edited out.
Since the cup appeared closest to Clarke in the scene, she's had to bear the brunt of the blame for the anachronism. Even Sophie Turner, who played Sansa on the show, admitted she blamed Clarke at first. But she then turned her blame on Kit Harrington, who played Jon Snow.

Clarke finally cleared up any confusion Wednesday night on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon."" She said Conleth Hill, who played Varys eventually confessed to her he started ""coffee-gate.""

Some parents may throw a Halloween party instead of trick-or-treating in the poor air. Others say they may take their children out wearing masks.

Other families are opting to leave town in time to trick-or-treat elsewhere.

The fire has been burning since last week, and others have ignited in Southern California.

New method detects early stage liver disease,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects between 80 and 100 million adults in the United States, or 30‚Äì40% of the population.

Together with alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD is responsible for most cases of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer.

The rates of chronic liver disease deaths have been on the rise in the U.S. According to one study, the annual death toll from cirrhosis increased by 65% between 1999 and 2016. During the same period, the yearly number of liver cancer deaths doubled.

NAFLD is also on the rise, as the prevalence of this condition increases proportionately with that of type 2 diabetes and obesity.

Despite being a slow advancing condition, doctors often diagnose liver disease in its latest stages. But new research may soon change this.

A team led by Jenny Yang, a Regents' Professor in Chemistry at Georgia State University in Atlanta, has developed a noninvasive, reliable method of diagnosing liver disease in its early stages.

Prof. Yang and colleagues detail their findings in the journal Nature Communications.

The researchers developed a more sensitive contrast dye than the regular ones that MRI scans use.

This substance, called ProCA32.collagen1, detects the overexpression of collagen, which is a biomarker of liver disease. The dye also binds closely with gadolinium, a contrast metal that MRI scans routinely use.

Prof. Yang and team tested their new method in mice with liver fibrosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and found that it could accurately detect these conditions.

Also, the researchers discovered that the substance was twice as effective as regular contrast dyes. Tests using tissue samples from human participants showed that the substance was able to detect tumors that were 100 times smaller than those that currently used contrast agents detected.

This is ""the first robust detection of early and late stage liver fibrosis and early stage NASH in addition to heterogeneous expression of collagen by multiple imaging techniques,"" write the authors.

Prof. Yang, who is also the associate director of Georgia State's Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, comments on the findings, saying they ""would help doctors monitor treatment before it is irreversible and help pharmaceutical companies to select the right patients for clinical trials or identify subjects for drug discovery.""

""Our contrast agent can do dual color, so you have different contrast colored features, so the sensitivity shows up better, and accuracy is a lot better,"" adds Yang.

""Early stage fibrosis and NASH can be reversed if it is detected early,"" the authors write in their paper. ""However, current techniques, including FibroScan and MRE as well as MRI with current clinical contrast agents, failed to detect early stages of NASH and fibrosis.""

Prof. explains that the new method could help people implement lifestyle changes earlier.

""Most people do not believe they have liver fibrosis and don't want to change their lifestyle, and we cannot detect it early,"" she says.

""So, what happens is, they continue their lifestyle and, at some point, develop later stage fibrosis, which can become severe cirrhosis, and a large portion become liver cancer.""

"Jennifer Riley Collins: 'I'm not running to make history, I am running to make a difference' as AG","We can help Jennifer Riley Collins make history this year in Mississippi. She could become the first woman elected attorney general and the first African American elected statewide since Reconstruction. Those are big deals, but if you ask her, she'll tell you: ""I'm not running to make history, I am running to make a difference.""

""I believe the law is supposed to be a shield and not a weapon, to heal and not to hurt, to pull us together and not divide us. I am running to make a difference for ALL Mississippians,"" Riley Collins said. She can do that as attorney general. She's lived the kind of life that makes her uniquely qualified to do so. For one thing, she's the mother of a young black man in Mississippi. ""No mother should ever have to scream, 'Please comply. Don't die,'"" she told the AP in an interview. When it comes to law enforcement in her state, the civil rights lawyer and Army veteran will ""lead from the front,"" as she learned to do in the military, ""in building trust between law enforcement and community."" That means training law enforcement. ""Are you putting yourself in a posture where you are being received by community,"" she asked, ""or are you showing up and treating community like they're enemy combatants?""

Her opponent, who has refused to make any public appearances or (apparently) give live interviews, responded to the AP in writing. ""As attorney general, I will support our law enforcement community,"" she said when asked about the kind of training Riley Collins is proposing. ""I believe that proper training is important for everyone and will be a priority of mine."" That's informative. A better glimpse into her mindset is that she says she will bring a ""conservative principles and solution-driven approach"" to the job ""to tackle great challenges like the opioid crisis and human trafficking."" That's going out on a limb.

Mississippi has a tremendous chance to change. It needs to, after sending a woman who made ""jokes"" about attending a public hanging to D.C. as its senator. Mississippi can change, and Riley Collins could help that happen.

Your last-minute help can get her over the finish line. It could help feed hungry volunteers and help keep them on the phone and knocking on doors for GOTV. It could help pay for the gas to get people to the polls next Tuesday. It could help change Mississippi.

US armored vehicles in Syria to guard oil fields,"BEIRUT (AP) ‚Äì The U.S. military says its first batch of mechanized armored vehicles have arrived in southeast Syria, where they are to take part in securing oil fields and fighting remnants of the Islamic State group. 

U.S.-led Coalition spokesman Col. Myles Caggins said the first batch of Bradley armored infantry carriers have arrived Thursday in Deir el-Zour Province. The province is home to some of Syria‚Äôs largest oil fields. It is also where IS militants continue to wage an insurgency and where they lost their last territory in March. 

Caggins said the mechanized forces ‚Äì being deployed for the first time in Syria‚Äì provides infantry with maneuverability and firepower. He said the deployment is ‚Äúde-conflicted‚Äù with other forces operating in the region. 

U.S. troops have begun withdrawing from northern Syria to reposition in the Deir el-Zour region, he said.

More Aid Workers Killed in South Sudan - South Sudan,"Government Should Investigate Attacks, Lift Restrictions on Access to Aid

Three more aid workers, this time staff from the International Organization for Migration (IOM), have been killed in South Sudan, the latest in a long line of frontline workers who have become casualties of the country‚Äôs devastating six-year war.

The three IOM workers were reportedly killed in crossfire on October 27, during clashes between government forces and a rebel group, National Salvation Front (NAS), in Morobo, Central Equatoria region. Two other workers were injured, and a female worker and the four-year-old son of one of the deceased workers were abducted. Both sides deny responsibility for the crimes.

Attacks against aid workers and aid operations have been a common occurrence since hostilities broke out in December 2013, with both government forces and rebels and allied militia bearing responsibility. Aid workers have been victims of unlawful killings, abductions, sexual violence, and other abuses. Aid supplies and property have been looted and destroyed.

This attack occurred just weeks after a high-level visit by the United Nations Security Council and continued efforts by regional actors to keep South Sudan‚Äôs peace deal afloat. The killings are a reminder of the need for concerted pressure on parties to respect human rights and humanitarian law as well as ensure justice for atrocities.

Although fighting has subsided across the country, the UN found that attacks and harassment of aid workers have continued, including ambushes, detentions, abductions, and restrictions on access, especially in the Equatoria region. Human Rights Watch has documented similar attacks against aid workers and other civilians by both sides earlier this year during government counterinsurgency operations in Yei and other parts of Central Equatoria.

That 115 aid workers ‚Äì most of them South Sudanese ‚Äì have been killed since 2013 is a sobering fact. Families have been left without breadwinners and loved ones. Many other aid workers have suffered physical and mental injuries.

Targeting aid workers is a war crime. These attacks not only impact the lives and wellbeing of those working at the front line but also disrupt the provision of life-saving assistance and services to people in need.

South Sudan continues to be one of the world‚Äôs largest humanitarian crises, with seven million people relying on humanitarian aid. Humanitarian workers play an essential role, often working in difficult conditions, to alleviate suffering.

All parties should end attacks on aid workers, investigate all attacks, and ensure those responsible for the crimes are brought to justice.",Not Incident

Lisburn IRA bomb victim ‚Äòdisgusted‚Äô at desecration of memorial wreaths,"A survivor of an IRA bomb that claimed the lives of six soldiers in 1988 has spoken of her ‚Äúdisgust‚Äù after memorial wreaths were vandalised.

                Andrea Brown suffered life-changing injuries in the 1988 IRA 'fun run' bombing

            
            



She was one of 11 bystanders injured in the blast on the Market Street area of Lisburn on June 15, 1988, following a ‚Äòfun run‚Äô charity half marathon.
The soldiers killed in the bomb attack had been in an unmarked military vehicle when the IRA device detonated.
            
        
    


A number of poppy wreaths left close to the site of the attack were discovered vandalised today.
Mrs Brown said: ‚ÄúThe families of those six soldiers viewed those men as heroes. That‚Äôs how I view them as well because that‚Äôs what they were.
‚ÄúThey will be devastated when they find out about this vandalism.
‚ÄúIt is disgusting. Why would anyone do this? Some people just want to cause hurt.‚Äù
She continued: ‚ÄúThere have been wreaths there for a very long time. Last year was the 30th anniversary and I‚Äôll never forget that someone had put six pairs of trainers with flowers in them. It was the most beautiful thing in memory of the soldiers. There are people who genuinely care, but there are people who genuinely don‚Äôt.‚Äù
DUP Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson condemned the incident.

NFL or the Olympics? USC RB Kenan Christon wants to do both,"USC‚Äôs athletic history is a rich and storied one. The Trojans have won 107 NCAA championships among all their various programs. The football team has produced seven Heisman Trophy winners and 12 Pro Football Hall of Famers. So there aren‚Äôt many firsts left to accomplish for current USC athletes. 

But one thing has never been done before by a Trojan: Play in the NFL and participate in the Olympic Games. 

That‚Äôs something that Kenan Christon is aiming to change. 
						

						 
The freshman running back has taken center stage the past two weeks after USC‚Äôs top three backs went down with injuries. In the spring, he‚Äôll participate as a sprinter on the USC track and field team. His dream is to reach the professional pinnacle of both sports, and be the rare modern-day trailblazer in USC athletics. 

					
				

‚ÄúI think it would be a great deal just to not only be the first but at least be able to set an example for anyone who maybe thinks, ‚ÄòOh, I can‚Äôt do that,‚Äô‚Äù Christon said. ‚ÄúI just want people to be like, ‚ÄòOh, I can do that. He did it, so why can‚Äôt I?‚Äô‚Äù 

The list of NFL Olympians is 38 names long. Most famously, Herschel Walker competed in bobsledding in the 1992 Winter Games and Jim Thorpe won two gold medals in 1912. 

And Christon certainly has the speed to aspire to the Olympics one day. As a senior at Madison High, he won four events at the 2019 CIF San Diego meet and won the state title in the 100 meters, tying the meet record with a 10.30-second run. He was named the Gatorade California Boys Track and Field Athlete of 2019. 

The young Trojan last ran a 40-yard dash in his sophomore year of high school. His time: 4.4 seconds. The NFL combine record, held by Cincinnati Bengals receiver John Ross out of Long Beach Jordan, is 4.22. 

Christon‚Äôs speed in readily apparent when you watch him play. In his first game as a Trojan, he broke off a 55-yard touchdown run. Running backs coach Mike Jinks called a touchdown the moment Christon hit the line of scrimmage. 

					
				

Head coach Clay Helton sounds practically giddy when talking about watching Christon run. 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a home-run hitter. I thought he had a couple times where he was right there at the last, and I was like, ‚ÄòOh my goodness, if he gets by this one guy he‚Äôs gone,‚Äô‚Äù Helton chuckled after USC‚Äôs win over Colorado last weekend. 

Christon started running track at 6 years old, and his goal since then has been to make it to the Olympics. He started playing football in sixth grade, and at first thought it was just another sport to play. 

Then he averaged over 20 yards per carry on the freshman team at Madison and realized a college scholarship and potential NFL career weren‚Äôt out of the question. 

‚ÄúHis junior and senior year, he put on that man strength,‚Äù Madison football coach Rick Jackson said. ‚ÄúAs a sophomore, he was a slasher. As a junior, those arm tackles weren‚Äôt bringing him down anymore. He was running through guys‚Äô shoulders.‚Äù 

But if Christon had to make a choice one day between football and track? 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Christon said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been asked that question, and every time, I just have such a great love for both of those sports. I really don‚Äôt know.‚Äù 

Kenan Christon Sr. knows it will ultimately be his son‚Äôs decision to make. But if asked for advice, he would say to stick to football. 

‚ÄúTrack is always there. You‚Äôre always able to run,‚Äù Christon Sr. said. ‚ÄúYou play football for five, six, seven, eight years and still be able to run track after that, barring any injuries.‚Äù 

Christon Sr. was a pretty good athlete himself in high school in Ohio, also participating in track and football. He hoped to hit the gridiron at the collegiate level, but had a child shortly out of high school and joined the Navy to support his new family, moving across the country to San Diego. 

Sports have always been a key bond between the father and son. 

‚ÄúEver since he was little, I‚Äôve been teaching him about sports and how to take care of his body,‚Äù Christon Sr. said. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs good and who‚Äôs not.‚Äù 


Kenan Christon says one of the biggest influences on him as a running back is Walter Payton. The fit may seem like an odd one, but the Chicago Bears great was a favorite of his father. 

And Christon Sr. wanted his son to recognize the toughness and will to win that Payton displayed. It‚Äôs something he wants his son to carry with him wherever he goes, be it the NFL, the Olympics or just life in general. 

It led Kenan Christon to set his goal to be a dual-sport athlete in college. That‚Äôs in hand. As for what comes next, the USC freshman still has big dreams. 

‚ÄúI just want to be there, really,‚Äù Christon said of the NFL and Olympics. ‚ÄúBut podium would put the icing on the cake.‚Äù",Not Incident
Scientists Just Found a 'Needle in the Haystack' Black Hole Once Hidden From View,"An artist's impression of a black hole. In a new study, scientists identify a black hole in a non-interacting binary with a star, a discovery that could support future black hole findings.

Researchers have discovered a strange black hole-star pair, a finding that could open our eyes to millions of new black holes that, until now, have been hidden in the cosmos.

For years, scientists have assumed that there are millions of black holes in our galaxy . However, researchers can often only spot black holes that are in binary pairs with stars in which the black hole orbits and siphons matter from the star. This is because, when black holes accrete matter from their partner star, they emit bright, easy-to-spot X-rays.

But many black holes in these pairings don't orbit their star close enough to accrete mass and emit this bright signal, so they go undetected.

However, in a new study, scientists demonstrated how dimmer black holes can be spotted in the night sky.

Related: Dying Star Robbed of Its Stellar Mass by Covert Companion

In the study, scientists looked at a binary star system made up of the giant star 2MASS J05215658+4359220 and a companion, which, through a unique approach, they found is likely a low-mass black hole, lead author Todd Thompson, a professor in the Department of Astronomy at The Ohio State University, told Space.com.

To spot this dim, low-mass black hole, the research team ""had to develop a new type of search,"" Thompson said. Spotting the elusive black hole was a ""needle-in-the-haystack kind of search,"" he added.

To find the hidden black hole, the team began by poring through data from APOGEE, a survey that uses spectroscopy data to scour the sky for stars. After observing over 100,000 stars, the team identified which stars had significant doppler shift, or redshift and blueshift. Redshift occurs when the wavelengths of light coming from objects moving away from Earth get longer, and the object appears red; blueshift occurs when the wavelengths of light coming from objects moving closer shorten, and the object appears blue.

The team combined data on stars exhibiting doppler shift with data from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) project, in which robotic telescopes worldwide monitor the night sky and collect data on millions of stars. With this data, scientists can see the brightness of stars over time.

The researchers whittled down the list of stars to those ""that showed the most extreme doppler shift, Thompson said. They then looked at the stars' light curves, or how the brightness of those stars changed over time in the ASAS-SN data.

The ""combination of those two factors led us to this one particular star, this giant star in the outer galaxy,"" Thompson said about 2MASS J05215658+4359220.

The star's brightness kept changing, brightening and dimming back and forth. The team assumed, and later confirmed, that the brightness variations were in line with the orbital period of an object orbiting the star, Thompson said.

When they studied the system further, the researchers determined that the object must have a mass of around 3.3 solar masses (though they did give a fairly wide margin of error, from 2.6 to 6.1 solar masses). This mass is consistent with a low-mass black hole.

Identifying this black hole which, because it doesn't emit bright X-rays, had previously escaped detection by astronomers, is an important step forward in allowing researchers to more easily identify these ""hidden"" black holes, Thompson said.

This black hole is approximately 3.3 times the mass of the sun. That makes it much less massive than black holes in bright, X-ray-emitting systems, which are usually five to six solar masses. It's also less massive than black holes that merge across the universe in gravitational waves, which are often 20 to 30 solar masses, Thompson said. ""There are very few or possibly no systems that contain a black hole of around 3 or 3.3 [solar masses] ‚Ä¶ This is a very-low-mass system for a black hole,"" he said.

What's more, if this object is found to have the lowest mass deemed possible in its margin or error, it could turn out to be a neutron star ‚Äî the collapsed core of a giant, dead star ‚Äî at its maximum mass, Thompson said. Alternatively, if this object is closer to the upper range of its estimated mass, it would add to the definition of what qualifies as a black hole.

If 3.3 solar masses holds up, it's going to be ""quite important,"" Thompson said, adding that it ""will show us that these types of black holes are out there.""

In other words, if the black hole is, in fact, 3.3 solar masses as these researchers think it likely is, it will provide evidence for the assumption that there are possibly plenty of black holes in the cosmos that don't emit X-rays.

""This was our first candidate,"" Thompson said, adding that the team is ""working on trying to find new candidates using the same search method.""

The work was published today (Oct. 31) in the journal Science.

Why Dead Stars Go Boom: Scientists Eye Mechanism Behind Supernova Explosions,"The Tycho Type IA supernova remnant, as imaged by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. Low-energy X-rays (red) in the image show expanding debris from the supernova explosion and high energy X-rays (blue) show the blast wave, a shell of extremely energetic electrons.

The secret hearts of exploding stars are being dragged out into the light.

Type IA , which occur when superdense stellar corpses known as white dwarfs go boom after siphoning material from a companion star, are some of the most dramatic events in the universe.

These explosions are incredibly important to astronomers as well; because they feature a relatively fixed inherent luminosity, scientists use Type IA supernovae as "" "" to determine cosmic distances.

Indeed, two decades ago, observations of Type IA supernovae revealed that the universe's , a surprising find that earned three researchers the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics and led to the postulation of a mysterious repulsive force called .

But such work has used Type IA supernovae as tools. Delving into the inner workings of these deep-space blasts has proved more difficult.

""Ironically, given that wealth of observational data, we don't understand how they work,"" said Alexei Poludnenko, an associate professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Connecticut, told Space.com. ""And the theorists sort of have stagnated over the past couple of decades.""

Part of the reason for this stagnation, he added, is that the Type IA supernova detonation process remains shrouded in mystery. Specifically, it's unclear what spurs the transition from ""deflagration"" (a flame moving at less than the speed of sound) to ""detonation"" (a much more powerful event driven by a supersonic shock).

But the new study, which Poludnenko led, could help clear things up considerably.

He and his colleagues simulated the critical deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) using a newly devised model and performed laboratory experiments with chemical flames to check those results and validate the model.

The researchers found that the DDT in Type IA supernovae occurs spontaneously if flame-generated turbulence is high enough.

""We defined the critical criteria where we can drive a flame to self-generate its own turbulence, spontaneously accelerate, and transition into detonation,"" study co-author Kareem Ahmed, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University of Central Florida, said in a statement. ""We're using the turbulence to enhance the mixing of the reactions to the point where it transitions into this violent reaction and essentially leads to supernovas.""

The team also determined that this process is not unique to otherworldly thermonuclear blasts. (The new study does not deal with , which occur when massive stars die and collapse.)

""This is the same mechanism that also occurs in chemical systems, like hydrogen-air or methane-air, for example,"" Poludnenko told Space.com. ""Therefore, there's sort of a unifying story behind all of this.""

The team also worked out the conditions that will cause a white dwarf to go supernova. It's all about density: ""DDT is almost inevitable at densities of 10^7 to 10^8 grams per cubic centimeter,"" Poludnenko and his colleagues wrote in , which was published online today (Oct. 31) in the journal Science.

That is incredibly dense, which isn't surprising, considering that cram about half the mass of our sun into a sphere only slightly larger than Earth. (For perspective, Earth's density is 5.5 grams per cubic centimeter.)

Poludnenko hopes the new study helps open up Type IA supernovae to greater study. The next step, he said, involves applying the team's model to different explosion scenarios, to start nailing down the DDT details.

Such work could have far-reaching applications across cosmology and astrophysics. For example, though Type IA supernovae have similar intrinsic brightnesses, there is some variation here and there, Poludnenko said. And these slight differences might introduce biases into astronomers' calculations.

""These biases are critical, because they would affect the accuracy of how we calibrate distances in the universe and how we measure the properties of dark energy,"" Poludnenko said.

""Now, if we know how these things work, we can try to discover these biases,"" he added. As an example, he cited the possibility that Type IA supernovae that formed in older galaxies might have different brightnesses than their counterparts from young galaxies.

The new study could also have some applications here on Earth, potentially leading to improved propulsion systems for aircraft and spacecraft and more efficient power generation, team members said.

"Canadian Dollar Outlook: USD/CAD Surges, Is This The Bottom?","A certifiably dovish Bank of Canada rate decision sparked a formidable Canadian Dollar selloff on Wednesday, potentially shifting the longer-term outlook for the Loonie.

Now, the pair is fast approaching the nearby 200-day moving average around 1.33 which could look to briefly stall a continuation higher.

Out of thousands of stocks that hedge funds invest in, small-caps can provide the best returns over the long term due to the fact that these companies are less efficiently priced and are usually under the radars of mass-media, analysts and dumb money. This is why we follow the smart money moves in the small-cap space.

Is At Home Group Inc. (NYSE:HOME) a healthy stock for your portfolio? Money managers are getting less optimistic. The number of bullish hedge fund bets were cut by 17 lately. Our calculations also showed that HOME isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (see the video below). HOME was in 15 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June.

Hedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017.

Here is What Hedge Funds Think About AudioCodes Ltd. (AUDC),"Hedge funds and other investment firms that we track manage billions of dollars of their wealthy clients' money, and needless to say, they are painstakingly thorough when analyzing where to invest this money, as their own wealth also depends on it. Regardless of the various methods used by elite investors like David Tepper and David Abrams, the resources they expend are second-to-none. This is especially valuable when it comes to small-cap stocks, which is where they generate their strongest outperformance, as their resources give them a huge edge when it comes to studying these stocks compared to the average investor, which is why we intently follow their activity in the small-cap space. Nevertheless, it is also possible to identify cheap large cap stocks by following the footsteps of best performing hedge funds.

AudioCodes Ltd. (NASDAQ:AUDC) has experienced a decrease in hedge fund sentiment recently.

Precision Drilling Corp (PDS) Burned These Hedge Funds,"Is Precision Drilling Corp (NYSE:PDS) a good bet right now?

Did You Miss Trio-Tech International's (NYSEMKT:TRT) 20% Share Price Gain?,"Buying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But in any diversified portfolio of stocks, you'll see some that fall short of the average. That's what has happened with the Trio-Tech International (NYSEMKT:TRT) share price. It's up 20% over three years, but that is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 9.7% in the last year.

Check out our latest analysis for Trio-Tech International

In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

Trio-Tech International was able to grow its EPS at 24% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 6.1% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 9.01 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.

The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here..

Trio-Tech International shareholders are down 9.7% for the year, but the market itself is up 13%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 1.0% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. Is Trio-Tech International cheap compared to other companies? These 3 valuation measures might help you decide.

Is Flexion Therapeutics Inc (FLXN) A Good Stock To Buy?,"Most investors tend to think that hedge funds and other asset managers are worthless, as they cannot beat even simple index fund portfolios. In fact, most people expect hedge funds to compete with and outperform the bull market that we have witnessed in recent years. However, hedge funds are generally partially hedged and aim at delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns rather than following the ups and downs of equity markets hoping that they will outperform the broader market. Our research shows that certain hedge funds do have great stock picking skills (and we can identify these hedge funds in advance pretty accurately), so let‚Äôs take a glance at the smart money sentiment towards Flexion Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FLXN).

Hedge fund interest in Flexion Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FLXN) shares was flat at the end of last quarter. This is usually a negative indicator. At the end of this article we will also compare FLXN to other stocks including Loop Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOOP), Global Indemnity Limited (NASDAQ:GBLI), and Powell Industries, Inc.

At Q2's end, a total of 15 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 0% from one quarter earlier. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in FLXN over the last 16 quarters. With hedge funds' positions undergoing their usual ebb and flow, there exists an ""upper tier"" of noteworthy hedge fund managers who were increasing their holdings considerably (or already accumulated large positions).

Among these funds, Miller Value Partners held the most valuable stake in Flexion Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FLXN), which was worth $59.7 million at the end of the second quarter. On the second spot was Kingdon Capital which amassed $11.4 million worth of shares. Moreover, Clearline Capital, Rubric Capital Management, and D E Shaw were also bullish on Flexion Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FLXN), allocating a large percentage of their portfolios to this stock. Seeing as Flexion Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FLXN) has experienced a decline in interest from the aggregate hedge fund industry, we can see that there lies a certain ""tier"" of fund managers that decided to sell off their full holdings heading into Q3. It's worth mentioning that Joe DiMenna's ZWEIG DIMENNA PARTNERS sold off the largest position of all the hedgies tracked by Insider Monkey, comprising about $1.1 million in stock, and Jeffrey Talpins's Element Capital Management was right behind this move, as the fund cut about $0.3 million worth. These moves are important to note, as total hedge fund interest stayed the same (this is a bearish signal in our experience). Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Flexion Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FLXN) but similarly valued. We will take a look at Loop Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOOP), Global Indemnity Limited (NASDAQ:GBLI), Powell Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWL), and Noble Corporation plc (NYSE:NE).

That figure was $112 million in FLXN's case. Noble Corporation plc (NYSE:NE) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Loop Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:LOOP) is the least popular one with only 1 bullish hedge fund positions. Flexion Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FLXN) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our calculations showed that top 20 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 24.4% in 2019 through September 30th and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 4 percentage points. Hedge funds were also right about betting on FLXN as the stock returned 11.5% during the third quarter and outperformed the market. Hedge funds were rewarded for their relative bullishness.

Hedge funds underperform because their net exposure in only 40-70% and they charge exorbitant fees. No one knows what the future holds and how market participants will react to the bountiful news that floods in each day. However, hedge funds' consensus picks on average deliver market beating returns.

Sentinel Energy Services Inc. (NASDAQ:STNL) shares haven't seen a lot of action during the second quarter. Overall, hedge fund sentiment was unchanged. The stock was in 15 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June. The level and the change in hedge fund popularity aren't the only variables you need to analyze to decipher hedge funds' perspectives. A stock may witness a boost in popularity but it may still be less popular than similarly priced stocks.

"Even after Lyft beat, Wall Street pummels former unicorns","Traders work on the floor at the NYSE in New York

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Wall Street pummeled shares of companies including Lyft , Uber Technologies , SmileDirectClub  and Slack Technologies  on Thursday as investors grew more sour on money-losing former startups that listed their shares this year in hyped-up IPOs.

Lyft tumbled 5% after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results late on Wednesday, while Pinterest dropped 2% ahead of its report after the bell.

Uber slumped 7%, bringing its decline since its May initial public offer to 30%. SmileDirectClub also fell 5%, extending the loss since its IPO last month to 49%, despite a wave of ""buy"" ratings this month from investment banks involved in listing the company, which sells plastic teeth aligners, a rival to traditional braces, directly to customers.

Crowdstrike Holdings , Beyond Meat  and Slack each fell 3% or more.

The day's selling in those stocks reflects investors' growing distaste for a wave of high-profile companies that went public this year, many of them cloaked in the trappings of technology companies worthy of the highest valuations, despite being unprofitable.

""There's an utter lack of appetite for unprofitable tech companies,"" said Joel Kulina, senior vice president of institutional cash equities at Wedbush Securities. ""People just want the year to end, and protect any profits they have, and not try to catch any falling knives.""

Underscoring Wall Street's increasing selectiveness, Lyft's stock fell after it said higher-than-expected third-quarter revenues and an improved outlook showed it was well on its way to profitability by the end of 2021.

Uber, Lyft's larger rival, is expected to post a 25% increase in revenue to $3.69 billion and a loss of $1.45 billion when it reports on Monday. For full 2019, analysts expect revenue growth of 24%, down from 42% growth in 2018.

Online scrapbook company Pinterest is up 32% since its April IPO, making it among the more successful of this year's series of IPOs from ""unicorns"" - rare startups valued at over $1 billion. It is trading at almost 10 times expected revenue, according to Refinitiv, a high valuation common among the group.

Due to report after Thursday's stock market close, Pinterest was expected by analysts to post a quarterly non-GAAP net loss of $27.6 million.

Plant burger seller Beyond Meat last Monday reported its first-ever net profit and raised its full-year sales forecast, but its shares have fallen 19% since then. The stock has been hurt in part by the lifting of a restriction on insiders and employees selling their shares, which are still up 243% since Beyond Meat's May IPO. Analysts on average expect Beyond Meat to lose more money over the next two quarters.

Unprofitable U.S. companies holding IPOs this year have had a median stock loss of 2%, compared to a median increase of 4% for profitable companies that held IPOs, according to a Reuters analysis. The S&P 500 has grown 21% in 2019.",Not Incident
"Here is What Hedge Funds Think About Hawkins, Inc. (HWKN)","Investing in hedge funds can bring large profits, but it‚Äôs not for everybody, since hedge funds are available only for high-net-worth individuals. They generate significant returns for investors to justify their large fees and they allocate a lot of time and employ complex research processes to determine the best stocks to invest in. A particularly interesting group of stocks that hedge funds like is the small-caps. The huge amount of capital does not allow hedge funds to invest a lot in small-caps, but our research showed that their most popular small-cap ideas are less efficiently priced and generate stronger returns than their large- and mega-cap picks and the broader market. That is why we pay special attention to the hedge fund activity in the small-cap space. Nevertheless, it is also possible to find underpriced large-cap stocks by following the hedge funds' moves.

Hawkins, Inc. (NASDAQ:HWKN) shareholders have witnessed an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers recently. HWKN was in 7 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2019. There were 6 hedge funds in our database with HWKN positions at the end of the previous quarter. Our calculations also showed that HWKN isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (see the video below).

In the financial world there are a large number of tools investors have at their disposal to grade stocks. A pair of the most under-the-radar tools are hedge fund and insider trading indicators. We have shown that, historically, those who follow the top picks of the best fund managers can outperform the broader indices by a solid amount. Insider Monkey's flagship best performing hedge funds strategy returned 25.8% year to date (through May 30th) and outperformed the market even though it draws its stock picks among small-cap stocks. This strategy also outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since its inception (see the details here). That's why we believe hedge fund sentiment is a useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.

Unlike former hedge manager, Dr. Steve Sjuggerud, who is convinced Dow will soar past 40000, our long-short investment strategy doesn't rely on bull markets to deliver double digit returns.

Given their 2 and 20 payment structure, hedge funds have more incentives and resources than the average investor. The funds have access to expert networks and get tips from industry insiders. They also have numerous Ivy League graduates and MBAs. Like everyone else, hedge funds perform miserably at times, but their consensus picks have historically outperformed the market after risk adjustments.

So, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the market by 40 percentage points since May 2014 through May 30, 2019 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.

Here‚Äôs What Hedge Funds Think About Oritani Financial Corp. (ORIT),"Many investors, including Paul Tudor Jones or Stan Druckenmiller, have been saying before the Q4 market crash that the stock market is overvalued due to a low interest rate environment that leads to companies swapping their equity for debt and focusing mostly on short-term performance such as beating the quarterly earnings estimates. In the first half of 2019, most investors recovered all of their Q4 losses as sentiment shifted and optimism dominated the US China trade negotiations. Nevertheless, many of the stocks that delivered strong returns in the first half still sport strong fundamentals and their gains were more related to the general market sentiment rather than their individual performance and hedge funds kept their bullish stance. In this article we will find out how hedge fund sentiment to Oritani Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:ORIT) changed recently.

Oritani Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:ORIT) shareholders have witnessed a decrease in activity from the world's largest hedge funds lately. Our calculations also showed that ORIT isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (see the video below).

The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in ORIT over the last 16 quarters. With hedgies' capital changing hands, there exists a select group of key hedge fund managers who were upping their holdings substantially (or already accumulated large positions).

The largest stake in Oritani Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:ORIT) was held by Renaissance Technologies, which reported holding $35 million worth of stock at the end of March. It was followed by Winton Capital Management with a $0.5 million position. Other investors bullish on the company included AQR Capital Management, Two Sigma Advisors, and Arrowstreet Capital. Judging by the fact that Oritani Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:ORIT) has experienced declining sentiment from hedge fund managers, it's easy to see that there lies a certain ""tier"" of funds that slashed their positions entirely by the end of the second quarter. At the top of the heap, Israel Englander's Millennium Management dumped the largest stake of the ""upper crust"" of funds followed by Insider Monkey, worth about $0.9 million in stock, and Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was right behind this move, as the fund cut about $0.8 million worth. These bearish behaviors are intriguing to say the least, as aggregate hedge fund interest fell by 1 funds by the end of the second quarter. Let's now take a look at hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Oritani Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:ORIT) but similarly valued. These stocks are ConnectOne Bancorp Inc (NASDAQ:CNOB), Clovis Oncology Inc (NASDAQ:CLVS), Enova International Inc (NYSE:ENVA), and Boingo Wireless Inc (NASDAQ:WIFI).

Paul Allen/Andfotography.comDuring my semi-annual visit to Global Fashion Collective's showcase of emerging designers at New York Fashion Week, I always find new attractions to visit and new places to stay, dine and drink. This September was no exception and armed with a New York City Pass, which offers free entry to New York‚Äôs top attractions, we managed to see a remarkable amount in our short visit, making new discoveries along the way.
New things to Do:

Our city passes included a ferry ride across New York harbour and while the Statue of Liberty on Liberty Island isn‚Äôt new, there‚Äôs a fascinating museum that just opened in 2019. Spread across three gallery spaces, the museum depicts the Statue of Liberty‚Äôs history experience with various documents and artefacts, including Lady Liberty‚Äôs original torch. Access to the museum is free, which is open the same hours as Liberty Island. With a City Pass,  you can take the boat trip to the island and visit the new museum. The pass also allows free access to six major New York sites, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Guggenheim and the Empire State Building and it‚Äôs good for nine consecutive days.
Jonathan Prince's Shatter series of steel sculptures at Christie's Sculpture Garden on Madison ... [+] Avenue
Paul Allen/Andfotography.comIf viewing art outside of the usual public galleries like the Met and the Guggenheim is of interest, the Chelsea gallery scene seems to be regularly changing with the addition of new commercial galleries showing contemporary art. New to the area this year are two outposts of well-known London galleries that are worth checking out, Marlborough and Blain Southern. Public art is plentiful in New York. It‚Äôs always worth visiting the roof terrace at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to see what new sculptural works await. Nearby, in Christie‚Äôs Sculpture Garden just off Madison Avenue, be sure to see Jonathan Prince‚Äôs two-tonne steel sculptures. 

The brilliant elevated former railway turned park, the High Line, has regularly changing exhibitions along the entire one and a half mile path. Until March 2020, En Plein Air features the work of eight painters who‚Äôve displayed their work. Ei Arakawa, Firelei B√°ez, Daniel Buren, Sam Falls, Lubaina Himid, Lara Schnitger, Ryan Sullivan, and Vivian Suter work in the tradition of outdoor painting. If the weather is warm, take a moment to relax on one of the vast wooden loungers or dip your toes in the flowing ‚Äòriver‚Äù that runs along part of the route.
New Places to Stay and Eat:
The Paradise Club at The Edition, Times Square
Paul Allen/Andfotography.comIan Schrager‚Äôs hotel group has recently opened The Edition, a lavish property with 452 guestrooms, right in the heart of vibrant Times Square. While this may seem a somewhat odd location for a luxury hotel, it was a deliberate choice as it‚Äôs close to Schrager‚Äôs legendary Studio 54 and anyone, once you‚Äôre inside, it‚Äôs an oasis of calm. Dining options are stellar with Chef John Fraser (also of The Loyal and Michelin-starred NIX) overseeing all four dining options at The Edition. 
The Terrace Bar at The Edition, Times Square
Paul Allen/Andfotography.com701West is the signature fine-dining option at The Edition and it has already gained critical praise with three stars from the New York Times. The decor is as gorgeous as the food, with electric blue and green velvet banquettes, mahogany wood panels and white marble mosaic floors. The dishes on the frequently changing three-course prix fixe menu are cleverly paired with with the extensive Old World wine list. Before or after a meal at 701 West, have drinks at the Paradise Club, The Terrace bar or the more low key Lobby Bar.

The W Hotel across the road is another luxury option in Times Square, offering 509 guestrooms with brilliant views of the Manhattan skyline. As with all W hotels, this property lives up to its reputation as a party hotel, with buzzy bars that seem to be always filled with happy customers. But the comfortable guest rooms are well away from the action so a good night‚Äôs sleep is assured. The hotel also has good dining options on site with Blue Fin serving an Asian-inspired breakfast and sushi for breakfast and dinner or Dos Caminos offering decent Mexican food.
Santiago Calatrava's brilliant new transport hub at  ground zero
Paul Allen/Andfotography.comThe Four Seasons in the Financial District is located near the new skyscraper, One World Trade Center, on the site of the former Twin Towers and the 9/11 memorial. Many guestrooms have views of Santiago Calatrava‚Äôs fantastic Oculus, the new transportation hub at ground zero. Unlike most New York hotel rooms, the 189 suites, rooms and bathrooms at the Four Seasons are large and offer the standard of luxury you‚Äôd expect from any Four Seasons property. The generously sized rooms have fantastically comfortable king-sized beds with the softest, high thread count sheets and decor in a chic neutral color palette. The restaurant on site is Wolfgang Puck‚Äôs CUT, rightly renowned for its steaks.
Lamia's Fish Market, East Village, New York
Paul Allen/Andfotography.comLamia‚Äôs Fish Market, an excellent new seafood restaurant recently opened in East Village by Lamia Funti, pays homage to her Mediterranean roots. The extensive menu includes a selection of whole fish baked in salt (served at your table with little wooden mallets to break the salt crust), oysters, ceviche and carpaccio that change daily. Menu highlights were of course the house speciality, the salt baked fish (we loved the branzino), the octopus carpaccio, the scallop piri piri and the red snapper taquitos.

Superb seafood aside, the attention to detail in the ocean themed design by Avia Collective is impressive in this sprawling 7,000 foot square space over two floors. Green and blue ceramic walls, green banquets and beautiful round lamps, each one individually hand painted by a different artist, are just a few of the arresting design features.
Ginny's Supper Club at Red Rooster Harlem
Paul Allen/Andfotography.comA musical feast at Chef Marcus Samuelsson‚Äôs Red Rooster in Harlem at 125th and Lenox Avenue will not disappoint. Every day of the week, live musicians including jazz veterans and emerging talents perform. The comfort food menu celebrates the roots of American cuisine and the neighborhood‚Äôs diverse culinary traditions. The hot honey yardbird is a must, as is Marcus‚Äôs cornbread. And to extend your musical experience, don‚Äôt miss Ginny's Supper Club, a speakeasy downstairs, where some of Harlem‚Äôs best musicians and singers perform.
Empire Diner, New York
Empire DinerEmpire Diner from Chef John DeLucie and the people behind Cafeteria is more sophisticated in decor and vibe than a classic New York diner but who‚Äôs complaining? Both the food and atmosphere are faultless. Since first opening in 1976, the restaurant in the Art Deco building has gone from being a classic American  diner to more of a restaurant with a more refined menu that along with diner classics like mac and cheese and burgers, includes items like bucatini and a tuna poke bowl. 

Paper Daisy at St Marks Place is a lively new cocktail bar and cafe created by a group of friends from some of East Village‚Äôs best bars (Drexler‚Äôs, Boulton  Watt and Mister Paradise). The cocktails have catchy names like Tijuana Petting Zoo and Disco and Donuts, the latter of which packs a mighty punch with scotch, mezcal and bitters. The food menu is inviting too. Chef Ali Sahin, from Daniel, Rouge Tomate and CB, has created Mediterranean food menu with tasty items like clams and chorizo and grilled oysters with paprika butter. One final food and drink recommendation is Serafina in the Meatpacking district has a happy hour with half price drinks and food at the bar.

MRC‚Äôs Brent Bozell: Twitter Ban on Political Ads an Attempt to Muzzle Conservatives,"RESTON, VA ‚Äî On Thursday, Media Research Center Founder and President Brent Bozell released a statement about Twitter‚Äôs decision to ban all political advertising. Bozell called the explanation ‚Äúlaughable‚Äù and an attempt to ‚Äúfurther limit the ability of conservatives to get their message heard.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo pretend Twitter is taking the moral high ground in banning political ads is laughable. Twitter sees the backlash Facebook has received for embracing free speech in advertising and with this ban, hopes to force their hand into doing the same.

A key reason organizations and individuals buy ads is to promote an issue that they cannot get covered by conventional means. We have seen how the social media giants have used their content policies to suppress conservative speech. Because of this, liberal messaging dominates Twitter and by restricting ads, Twitter can further limit the ability of conservatives to get their message heard.

By including ‚Äòissue ads‚Äô in this ban, Twitter has given itself the power to draw the lines on what is and is not ‚Äòpolitical.‚Äô Make no mistake, this is not an easily defined space and with Twitter‚Äôs history of liberal activism, conservatives should be very concerned.‚Äù",Not Incident
Molecular gatekeepers that regulate calcium ions vital for muscle health and repair,"Calcium ions are essential to how muscles work effectively, playing a starring role in how and when muscles contract, tap energy stores to keep working and self-repair damage. Not only are calcium ions vital for the repair of injured muscle fibers, their controlled entry into the mitochondria, the cell's energy powerhouses, spells the difference between whether muscles will be healthy or if they will easily tire and perish following an injury, according to research published Oct. 29, 2019, in Cell Reports.

Lack of the protein mitochondrial calcium uptake1 (MICU1) lowers the activation threshold for calcium uptake mediated by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter in both, muscle fibers from an experimental model and fibroblast of a patient lacking MICU1. Missing MICU1 also tips the calcium ion balance in the mitochondria when muscles contract or are injured, leading to more pronounced muscle weakness and myofiber death."" Jyoti K. Jaiswal, MSc, Ph.D., principal investigator in the Center for Genetic Medicine Research at Children's National Hospital and one of the paper's corresponding authors

Five years ago, patients with a very rare disease linked to mutations in the mitochondrial gene MICU1 were described to suffer from a neuromuscular disease with signs of muscle weakness and damage that could not be fully explained.

To determine what was going awry, the multi-institutional research team used a comprehensive approach that included fibroblasts donated by a patient lacking MICU1 and an experimental model whose MICU1 gene was deleted in the muscles.

Loss of MICU1 in skeletal muscle fibers leads to less contractile force, increased fatigue and diminished capacity to repair damage to their cell membrane, called the sarcolemma. Just like human patients, the experimental model suffers more pronounced muscle weakness, increased numbers of dead myofibers, with greater loss of muscle mass in certain muscles, like the quadriceps and triceps, the research team writes.

""What was happening to the patient's muscles was a big riddle that our research addressed,"" Jaiswal adds. ""Lacking this protein is not supposed to make the muscle fiber die, like we see in patients with this rare disease. The missing protein is just supposed to cause atrophy and weakness.""

Patients with this rare disease show early muscle weakness, fluctuating levels of fatigue and lethargy, muscle aches after exercise, and elevated creatine kinase in their bloodstream, an indication of cell damage due to physical stress.

""One by one, we investigated these specific features in experimental models that look normal and have normal body weight, but also show lost muscle mass in the quadriceps and triceps,"" explains Adam Horn, Ph.D., the lead researcher in Jaiswal's lab who conducted this study. ""Our experimental model lacking MICU1 only in skeletal muscles responded to muscle deficits so similar to humans that it suggests that some of the symptoms we see in patients can be attributed to MICU1 loss in skeletal muscles.""

Future research will aim to explore the details of how the impact of MICU1 deficit in muscles may be addressed therapeutically and possible implications of lacking MICU1 or its paralog in other organs.",Not Incident
"Tinubu mourns ex-Lagos military governor, Mobolaji Johnson","All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu, on Thursday described the late Mobolaji Johnson ‚Äî the first military governor of the state ‚Äî as a Nigerian statesman and one of the true fathers of Lagos.

Mr Tinubu, in a statement signed by Tunde Rahman, his media aide, on Thursday in Lagos, also described Johnson, who retired brigadier general, as a man of high integrity who served Lagos with dedication and determination.

The general died on Wednesday in Lagos at the age of 83.

Mr Tinubu, in a condolence statement, said: ‚ÄúBrigadier-General Mobolaji Olufunso Johnson, who died on Wednesday at 83, was an important national statesman and one of the true fathers of Lagos.

‚ÄúFirst military Governor of Lagos, Johnson embodied the true spirit of Lagos. He served Lagos with dedication and determination.

‚ÄúHe contributed immensely to the state, developing the civil service. His tenure in Lagos also witnessed the building of major infrastructure in the state.‚Äù

Mr Tinubu said Mr Johnson was always available to advise and extend a helping hand to successive regimes in Lagos, and particularly to him during his time as governor.

According to him, Mr Johnson made laudable contributions to the unity of the country as one of those who fought for Nigeria‚Äôs indivisibility.

‚ÄúA committed nationalist, he laid the foundation for the development of the Federal Capital Territory as the first administrator of the former Federal Territory of Lagos in 1966.

‚ÄúJohnson was one of the two state Governors (along with Brig-Gen. Oluwole Rotimi) who was given a clean bill by the three-man panel commissioned to investigate the various allegations of corruption among the state governors who served under General Gowon.

‚ÄúNigeria will miss him; Lagos will miss him. We will all miss him.

‚ÄúI commiserate with his wife, children and other family members. My condolences also go to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the state government over the transition.

‚ÄúWe thank God Brigadier Johnson lived to an advanced age and left behind good children and significant legacies.

‚ÄúMay his soul rest in peace,‚Äù Mr Tinubu said.",Not Incident

Spooky Personal Ghost Stories from the Staff,"A Strange Painting
I‚Äôm four, maybe five. Sleeping in big boy bed, in a room I share with my younger brother, who‚Äôs fast asleep. Though I barely move at all now‚Äîmy girlfriend refers to my preferred sleeping position as The Bouncer: flat on back, arms crossed, no movement‚ÄîI tended to thrash a lot back then, and wake up often as a result. And so one night I found myself half-covered in blankets, awake...and staring at a young woman, dressed in flowy white clothing. She is sitting on the ground, back against the very large wooden toy box at the foot of my bed, reading a book. I think? The memory always feels a little fuzzy, and to be honest, at this point my mom tells it better than I do. But I saw her, and slowly pulled the sheets to my eyes, scared as fuck. I‚Äôd pull them back down, and she‚Äôd still be there, and I‚Äôd pull them back up. I don‚Äôt know how long this went on. An hour? 30 seconds?
Somehow I fell back asleep. Woke up the next morning, and told my mom what I‚Äôd seen. I don‚Äôt know if she believes in ghosts, but she doesn‚Äôt NOT believe in ghosts, and she listened and cared. And then.
And then.
Weeks later, my mom was digging through the attic for something, and she stumbled on a... picture-painting-thing, you know, like they did back in the '80s. Tchotchke art. It was a woman, in white, wrapped in clouds of fabric. We‚Äôd owned the house for a couple years at that point, so who knows where it came from. But my mom liked it and hung it up in the bathroom, so I got to relive my ghost story every time I took a leak. ‚Äî Jon Wilde, digital director
An Odd Coincidence
One winter night last year_, I was hanging out with some friends at their apartment on Rivington Street, in Manhattan‚Äôs Lower East Side. I had recently learned that my great-grandfather Izzy spent a chunk of his teenage days in an LES tenement, which I brought up to the group. I wondered how close the tenement might‚Äôve been to their place, so I texted my grandmother (Izzy‚Äôs daughter) to see what she knew. She found his World War I draft card, and it listed‚Ä¶ the exact same address as my friend‚Äôs apartment.
Obviously, it‚Äôs not the same building anymore. But it was still weird.
Then, a few minutes after that, we heard someone knocking on my friends‚Äô door‚Äîover and over and over again. They have a neighbor who complains about noise all the time, so we figured it was him. But when we opened the door, there was no one there. The knocking resumed again a few minutes later. We tried to laugh it off, but we were all sufficiently shook. And now, of course, I believe in ghosts. ‚Äî Alex Shultz, editorial assistant
A Girl and Her Dog
My dad is a photographer, and one time he stayed at this hotel up in Vermont for a shoot. He was woken up in the middle of the night when a little white dog ran through his room. Shortly after that, a young girl, about seven or eight years old, came into his room in pursuit of the dog. She sat at the foot of his bed and asked if he had seen her dog. He says he wasn't scared: It was just a normal little girl, but there was still something about the whole thing that felt supernatural. My dad told her it had ran into the bathroom and if she was lost and needed to find her parents. She said no, got up, and followed the dog into the bathroom.

ISIS names new leader as it confirms Baghdadi's death,"In the recording, published on the terrorist group's media wing al-Furqan, ISIS announced its new leader as Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi.

""America, do not be happy with the killing of Sheikh al-Baghdadi,"" the new spokesman said in the recording. ""Do you not realize that the State today is not only on the doorstep of Europe and in the center of Africa, it is staying and expanding from the east to the west.""

The commander of US Central Command, Gen. Frank McKenzie, said Wednesday that Baghdadi ""crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up while his people stayed on the ground"" during the Saturday night operation. The Pentagon released newly declassified video and images Wednesday of the raid which showed US forces taking small arms fire from multiple locations as their helicopters approached Baghdadi's compound. Video from an overhead drone also showed aerial strikes carried out by US F-15 fighter jets and MQ-9 Reaper Drones to blow up the site once it was cleared. McKenzie said the DNA used to confirm Baghdadi's identity was from samples collected during his previous detention at Camp Bucca in Iraq. Baghdadi's death marked the end of a years-long hunt to find one of the most wanted terrorists in the world. He has been in hiding for the last five years. In April, a video published by the ISIS media wing al-Furqan showed a man purporting to be Baghdadi. It was the first time he had been seen since July 2014, when he spoke at the Great Mosque in Mosul.",Not Incident
"U.S. October jobs report is likely to be a big dud, but not because the labor market is tanking","A big dud. That‚Äôs what Wall Street suspects when the government tells us how many new American jobs were created in October.

Not just because hiring in the U.S. has slowed, although it has. A six-week strike at General Motors might play an even bigger role. Here‚Äôs what to watch in the employment report due Friday morning. 



Economists polled by MarketWatch predict the U.S. added a meager 75,000 new jobs last month, down from a lackluster 136,000 in September.

If they‚Äôre right, it would be the third reading below 100,000 this year. The last time that happened was in 2012.

Such a Lilliputian tally would come with a huge caveat, however. The GM GM, -2.23%  strike kept at least 47,700 people out of work, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates. And perhaps more if workers at parts suppliers are included.

So add at least 50,000 to the headline number and go from there.

Realistically, any adjusted number of 150,000 or more would be considered decent. The U.S. has added an average of 161,000 new jobs a month in 2019. 



The nation‚Äôs jobless rate is forecast to rise slightly to 3.6% from a 3.5% reading in August that was the lowest in 50 years.

Don‚Äôt read much into any increase in the unemployment rate. The pace of layoffs have clung near a 50-year low since the start of the year and have shown no sign of rising. Businesses aren‚Äôt hiring as many workers, but they‚Äôre not firing many, either.

The average worker‚Äôs pay rose steadily from 2014 until earlier this year, when the yearly increase in wages topped out at a 10-year high of 3.4%.

Wage growth has slowed since then to just under 3% a year. Not bad, but disappointing in light of how tight the labor market is. Nor is it enough to push the economy to fresh heights.

Economists predict wages gains will cling to around 3% year over year.

Hiring in heavy industry softened considerably before GM GM, -2.23%  workers struck. American manufacturers had created just 41,000 net new jobs in the first nine months of 2019 even before the labor standoff.

The strike could basically wipe out all the gains for the year, but take it with a grain of salt. These jobs will be added back in November ‚Äî and make the November report look a lot stronger.

The slowdown in hiring in 2019 largely reflects weakness in manufacturing, construction and retail.

The traditional retail industry, under siege from Internet rivals, has reduced employment for eight straight months. Many forecasters predict another decline.",Not Incident

"Sequoia VC Roelof Botha Talks Direct Listings And SoftBank: ‚ÄòGood Investors Are Shock Absorbers, Not Amplifiers‚Äô","Sequoia partner Roelof Botha told entrepreneurs at the Under 30 Summit in Detroit: ‚ÄúHaving too much ... [+] money leads you to make silly decisions.‚Äù
Forbes MediaThe wake of WeWork‚Äôs unraveled IPO and questions about SoftBank‚Äôs Vision Fund have made the market murkier for unicorns looking to go public themselves. One of venture capital‚Äôs most prominent investors says the process is ripe for ‚Äúsome scrutiny and some change.‚Äù
Speaking at the Under 30 Summit in Detroit this week, Sequoia U.S. venture practice leader Roelof Botha weighed in on the IPO process and mega-funds like the Vision Fund, the best lesson he learned from late Sequoia founder Don Valentine, where the next ‚ÄòPayPal Mafia‚Äô may come from and more in a wide-ranging discussion with Forbes. Here are some of the highlights from the talk with the investor whose investments have included Bird, 23andme, Instagram, Unity, YouTube and Square.
The IPO Vs. Direct Listing Debate
Sequoia portfolio company Airbnb is reported to likely become the next high-profile tech company to go public via a direct listing instead of a traditional IPO when it pursues an exit next year. That choice would come after Slack pursued the same route in June and some investors, led by Benchmark‚Äôs outspoken Bill Gurley have publicly campaigned against what they see as a broken IPO process that benefits bankers while leaving money on the table for the listing companies and their shareholders.
Speaking on Monday, Botha voiced cautious (and SEC friendly) support for such efforts. Botha was CFO of PayPal when it went public in 2002, and has been a part of portfolio IPOs including Square (gained 45% in its first day of trading), Eventbrite (gained 60%) and MongoDB (gained 34%). ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a great feeling, honestly, to see the stock pop that much because it means you left money on the table. The company could have raised more for its balance sheet,‚Äù Botha said. ‚ÄúBut then the argument is that in the majority of these cases, it doesn‚Äôt really matter.‚Äù 
Botha pointed to Google and Square. Both companies have accrued much of their share price and market capitalization years after going public, he said. ‚ÄúSure, I wish the share price at the IPO was a little bit higher, but does it really make a difference today? Not really.‚Äù
But that doesn‚Äôt mean that Botha is against direct listings. ‚ÄúI do like that there‚Äôs innovation with the listening process. That part I commend, and I think it‚Äôs wonderful you see renewal,‚Äù he told the crowd. ‚ÄúThe IPO process as we know it today is decades old. Perhaps it‚Äôs time for some scrutiny and some change.‚Äù
SoftBank And Mega-Funds
With a reported $8 billion raised or planned to be raised for new funds last year, Sequoia could easily qualify as a mega-fund itself. Botha says such funds are a consequence of private companies shying away from the increased cost and short-term responsibilities of being a public company. 
Asked about the Vision Fund, Botha declined to take a shot directly at SoftBank amid its controversies. ‚ÄúGood board member, good investors, are shock absorbers, not amplifiers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHaving too much money leads you to make silly decisions.‚Äù
Botha told the story of PayPal realizing in June 2000 that it was burning $10 million per month with just seven months of ‚Äúrunway,‚Äù or time before it would run out of cash, left. The company had to begin charging for its service. ‚ÄúNo one was going to invest in the company anymore. So at some point, we realized we had to turn this into a business,‚Äù Botha said. ‚ÄúWe realized that, candidly, if we didn‚Äôt offer enough value that people were willing to pay for our service, that we didn‚Äôt really have a reason to exist.‚Äù
Botha had the following advice to entrepreneurs wondering how to navigate VC expectations on spending and growth: ‚ÄúCan you generate enough revenue with your service or product to cover your costs? Focus on that. And then you‚Äôll be able to get through those tough times as we did.‚Äù
 Peter Thiel and Elon Musk, seen here at PayPal's offices in 2000, brought on Roelof Botha as CFO in ... [+] 2002, just months before the company's IPO and then sale to eBay.
ASSOCIATED PRESSThe Next ‚ÄòPayPal Mafia‚Äô
Alongside Botha at PayPal were a group of future ventures and entrepreneurs who now wield major influence, and run some of the biggest businesses, in tech, including Elon Musk (Tesla), Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn), Peter Thiel (Founders Fund), Max Levchin (Affirm), David Sacks (Yammer), Keith Rabois (Square) and Jeremy Stoppelman (Yelp). 
Asked where the next PayPal-type group might come from, Botha said ‚Äúyou can never say never,‚Äù but expressed doubt that there will be one. ‚ÄúThe thing that was unique about PayPal is the company got acquired so early in its life, and it created one moment with so many left to do other interesting things. And it happened to coincide with the rise of broadband and the advent of Web 2.0.,‚Äù he said. Other businesses like Airbnb and Square may produce networks of alumni founders, Botha concedes. But they won‚Äôt do so at the same velocity, or the same close ties.
Sequoia‚Äôs Roots
Technology investor Don Valentine founded Sequoia in 1972, establishing one of the world‚Äôs most prominent VC firms. He passed away last week at age 87. Botha said one of the most important things Valentine did to build a multi-decade firm was to plan for succession early on. ‚ÄúDon had a very deliberate decision not to call it Valentine Capital,‚Äù said Botha. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those small things that seems really subtle but is really important. Don wanted to build a partnership that would outlive him, and that affected how he recruited people and how he treated them.‚Äù
A man of few words, Valentine preferred to leave his partners notes written in green ink rather than raise his voice in meetings, Botha said. With entrepreneurs, Valentine set a tone of listening first, speaking second, according to his colleague. ‚ÄúHe would sit there in a company meeting, and you would ask him a question afterwards, and he‚Äôd say one sentence. But it was the number one most important thing to think about.‚Äù
Sequoia also decided to work with non-profits, foundations and universities as its own financial backers, or limited partners. Those include Harvard, MIT, the Ford Foundation, the Cleveland Clinic and the Mayo Clinic, Botha said. ‚ÄúWhen we generate returns, we don‚Äôt have the rich get richer, we end up helping these organizations fight poverty, fight for social justice, combat climate change, to basic medical research. That‚Äôs the kind of thing that keeps us going,‚Äù he said. At Sequoia‚Äôs headquarters in Menlo Park, California, conference rooms are named after such limited partners. Sequoia has passed on investments in areas like vaping as not meeting its ethical standards.",Not Incident

                White House disputes Vindman account of transcript edits

                
                
                
                    
                

            

        

    



                                    

                                
                                                
                        
            WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî The question has long baffled lawmakers: What is missing from the White House's rough transcript of President Donald Trump phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskiy?


    
            Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman began to fill in gaps.


    
            In testimony for the House impeachment inquiry , Vindman, who worked at the White House National Security Council and monitored the July 25 phone call, told investigators he heard a discussion of Biden and Burisma ‚Äî a reference to the gas company where Joe Biden's son served on the board. He also said Trump brought up that there are recordings of Joe Biden discussing corruption in Ukraine, according to people familiar with Tuesday's closed-door testimony.


    
                                            
                    
            Vindman testified to House investigators that he tried to suggest changes to the transcript that was released by the White House, but was unsuccessful, the people said.


    
                                
            
                                

            
            The White House on Thursday pushed back on the idea that Vindman had suggested that the ellipses in the rough transcript represented missing information.


    
            White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that Vindman ""never suggested filling in any words at any points where ellipses appear in the transcript."" She added that because the House impeachment hearings are behind closed doors, ""we cannot confirm whether or not Lt. Col. Vindman himself made any such false claim.""


    
            Vindman's lawyer did not immediately return a call requesting comment.


    
            The Army officer's testimony provided new insight into the phone conversation that set off the impeachment inquiry and the extent to which the White House sought to shield the president's actions and words from the public.


    
                                
            
            ""As they said during Watergate, it's the cover-up,"" said Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, a California Democrat who sits on the House Oversight Committee. ""There was clearly an attempt at the White House to cover up.""


    
            The House impeachment inquiry is looking into Trump's call, in which he asked Zelenskiy for a ""favor"" ‚Äî to investigate Democrats in the 2016 election and Biden, a potential 2020 rival ‚Äî as the Trump administration held up military aid for the Eastern European ally confronting Russia.


    
            It is illegal to seek or receive assistance from a foreign entity in U.S. elections, and Democrats say this was a quid pro quo for political gain and an impeachable offense.


    
                                

            
            A government whistleblower claimed there was an attempt at the White House to cover up Trump's call by moving the transcript onto a secure server accessible to fewer people in the government.


    
            The White House ultimately released the rough transcript after the whistleblower complaint, but insists Trump did nothing wrong. Trump's team has said the president was concerned about rooting out corruption in Ukraine.


    
            In the White House rough transcript, there are three parts of the telephone call where ellipses replace what was said.


    
            In one, Trump asks Ukraine's president, ""I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say Crowdstrike...""


    
            That's a reference to the 2016 election, when Democrats hired the cyber firm, which determined Russia had hacked the party's email. Trump is airing a discredited conspiracy theory that CrowdStrike may have had ties to Ukraine and the hack was a setup designed to cast blame on Russia.


    
            ""I guess you have one of your wealthy people...,"" Trump says in another.


    
            Later Trump said, ""Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it ...""


    
            Some of the ellipses omitted Trump's suggestion to Zelenskiy that there are recordings of Joe Biden, according to one of the people familiar with the testimony.


    
            It is unclear what recordings Trump was referring to on the call. But the president and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, have defended their actions by citing a video of Biden from 2018. Speaking on a public panel, Biden recounted threatening to withhold a $1 billion loan guarantee from Ukraine's government unless it fired a prosecutor that the U.S. and other countries said was failing to fight corruption. Ukraine fired the prosecutor.


    
            Vindman told House investigators his efforts to add back the missing language were unsuccessful and the White House released the transcript with the gaps, the people said.


    
            There is no tape recording of the July 25 call . The White House stopped taping presidential calls in the 1970s when President Richard Nixon recorded 3,700 hours of conversations, transcripts of which were used by Watergate investigators and during impeachment hearings that followed.


    
            Instead, various officials listen into presidential calls and take extensive, real-time notes that are then turned into a rough transcript.


    
            For this call, Vindman was among those convened in the Situation Room and elsewhere to monitor the call. He testified that he listened with colleagues from the NSC and Vice President Mike Pence's office.


    
            Vindman later reported what he heard to the NSC's lead counsel. It was the second time he had reported his concerns about the Trump administration's actions toward Ukraine that are now central to the impeachment inquiry.


    
            ""I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,"" Vindman wrote in his prepared remarks to the House impeachment investigators. ""This would all undermine U.S. national security.""",Not Incident
"Pregnant Abbie Duggar Diagnosed With Hyperemesis Gravidarum & ""Hit Her Hard""","The Duggar family has always been an open book when it comes to their pregnancies, even when things don't go smoothly. From heartbreaking miscarriages, premature deliveries, and persistent nausea and exhaustion, viewers have followed the Duggar women through difficult times over the years. And another soon-to-be first time Duggar mama recently opened up about her rough pregnancy. As it turns out, John-David's wife Abbie Duggar was diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum and has understandably been struggling with the pregnancy condition.

As a refresher, John-David Duggar and Abbie (Burnett) tied the knot in November 2018, according to People. The newlyweds announced in early August that they're expecting their first child. Later that month, John and Abbie shared they're having a baby girl, In Touch Weekly reported.

Up until this point, news about Abbie's pregnancy has been nothing but positive. Behind the scenes, however, the expectant mom has apparently been struggling with a severe form of pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting called hyperemesis gravidarum (HG). According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, HG is rare and the ""exact cause ... is not known.""

""It hit her hard, and she was down for probably seven weeks with severe morning sickness,‚Äù John David told Us Weekly. ""She got diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum, and she was hospitalized a couple times. We made multiple visits to the ER for dehydration... She couldn‚Äôt eat, pretty much, or drink, or anything. So she was actually on IVs and had IVs at home. So that was a pretty scary time.""

As miserable as Abbie must be feeling, John-David has been doing his best to support his wife during this difficult time. The dedicated father-to-be told Us Weekly that he makes sure to keep Abbie's water filled up, keep snacks handy, and to provide whatever actually sounds appetizing to her‚Äî even if it means a midnight run to the grocery store.

Abbie sang her praises for her husband to the magazine, noting that John-David once made a special late-night trip to the store just to bring her a heat pack. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòNo, you need this. I want to go get it for you,‚Äô‚Äù she told Us Weekly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs cooked for me. He‚Äôs cleaned. He‚Äôs just been an angel.‚Äù (Awwww. So sweet.)

Interestingly, John and Abbie made no mention of HG when they revealed the pregnancy on Aug. 1, to be fair, though, they might not have had the diagnosis at this point. ‚ÄúWe are on Cloud 9 about welcoming our own little Duggar into the world,‚Äù the Counting On couple wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of themselves in an airplane. ‚ÄúIt really is amazing to think about being parents and having our own child to raise. We are thankful that God has blessed us with this new life and we look forward to taking on this new adventure!‚Äù

As awful as it must for Abbie that she's dealing with HG, I love that she and John David are sharing their experience. Amy Schumer is another high-profile celebrity who raised awareness for the often debilitating condition through her brutally honest social media photos and videos. Although I have a feeling Abbie won't be posting any clips of herself throwing up, I hope she continues to use her platform to shed light on the topic. Feel better soon, mama!",Not Incident
Kramnik to train budding Indian chess players in Spain,"IMAGE: This will be the second chess coaching camp to be conducted by Vladimir Kramnik for Indian players.

A group of up-and-coming Indian chess players will train under former World chess champion Vladimir Borisovich Kramnik in Spain in December, the organisers said on Thursday.



Indian chess legend Viswanathan Anand has also expressed his willingness to partner the company in helping the youngsters.

This will be the second chess coaching camp to be conducted by Kramnik for Indian players after the first one was held in Geneva for six young players.



The six players who attended the camp in Geneva were Grand Masters R Praggnanandhaa, D Gukesh, Raunak Sadhwani, P Iniyan, Prithu Gupta and International Master Leon Mendonca.



GM Arjun Erigasi, who missed out on the session due to an injury following an accident, is expected to be part of the Spain camp.



One or two other players are likely to join the six in the forthcoming camp.



Another camp is being planned in Chennai in the first quarter of next year where Kramnik and some other chess players will train Indian players across age categories.



Most of the participants in the camp conducted by Kramnik said they had benefitted a lot by interacting with the Russian legend and they believe that another session would be helpful.



Praggnanandhaa had after winning the World Under-18 title in Mumbai recently said the Kramnik camp was a big learning experience for him and others. 



Iniyan said he had benefited a lot by interacting with Kramnik, a view echoed by Praggnanandhaa.",Not Incident
Lehigh University art galleries receives institute of museum and library services grant,"Lehigh University's art museum is among 18 US institutions to receive prestigious grant from IMLS, the primary source of federal support for the nation's libraries and museums

Lehigh University Art Galleries is one of 18 institutions in the U.S. to receive a prestigious federal grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). The ""Museums Empowered"" grant will support the museum's work over the next two years to create and implement a strategic plan; train staff in outcomes-based, visitor-centered practices; and bring guest experts to Lehigh. Staff, who will collaborate with an external consultant, will also meet with colleagues at peer institutions in New York City and Philadelphia and share the art museum's work at a national conference.

The aim, LUAG Director William B. Crow, said, is to build capacity, increase impact and better serve the galleries' diverse audiences, which include college students, faculty and staff; PK-12 students and educators; and the local community of Bethlehem, Pa. and greater Lehigh Valley.

The Lehigh University Art Galleries holds a collection of more than 16,000 works of art from diverse cultures and time periods, in a wide range of media from photography and painting to video and sculpture. It generates more than a dozen exhibitions annually, produces scholarly publications and serves thousands of visitors a year. Lehigh University is a national research university with 5,000 undergraduate students, 2,000 graduate students and more than 500 faculty.

LUAG was notified in September that it had received the competitive $65,598 grant from IMLS, the primary source of federal support for the nation's libraries and museums. It will begin to implement tools and strategies immediately, Crow said.

Since its founding in 1926, LUAG focused on amassing its impressive collection of art and artifacts, and primarily measured outputs, in terms of number of exhibitions and visitors, Crow said. The grant gives the museum the opportunity to step back and instead assess outcomes: ""How do people benefit from the work we do? Is there a shift in knowledge, skills, attitudes or behaviors?,"" said Crow, who joined LUAG in August 2018.

""This grant will give us the tools to be able to assess and talk about our work in terms of how people benefit in measurable ways,"" he said, ""and to learn how we can align our work in the most advantageous way with the greater work of the university and the local community to really maximize the benefit that this great collection can give us.""

Among the goals the university and art galleries share are emphasis on a well-rounded student experience and interdisciplinary research and programming, Crow said. For example, he looks forward to collaborating with the university's newly created College of Health on projects exploring the relationship between art, health and well-being. Guest experts visiting through the grant will have the opportunity to meet with members of the campus community and to interact with the public.

LUAG will continue to work with its student advisory committee and will form an advisory committee in the local community. ""We want to identify how to serve the community's needs, at Lehigh and in the community,"" Crow said. It also will expand engagement with the region's growing Hispanic and Caribbean community, with many residents living in close proximity to Lehigh University and LUAG's sizeable collection of art from Latin America and the Caribbean.

While improving organizational management and building the capacity of LUAG's 7-member staff, the grant will result in more strategic, efficient and meaningful work for its audience, Crow said.

""We are very grateful to IMLS that they have supported our work because this is the really critical work that organizations have to do to become transformative, impactful places,"" he said.

Earl Thomas has a great vision for how he'll remember facing Tom Brady,"Earl Thomas didn't practice Wednesday for the Baltimore Ravens. But there's no chance he's missing a date with Tom Brady and the New England Patriots.

The Ravens safety confirmed as much Thursday, telling reporters he plans to play against the Patriots on Sunday night.

So, how does Thomas feel about Round 2 against the Patriots after Round 1 ended in his Seattle Seahawks losing Super Bowl XLIX on Malcolm Butler's goal-line interception?

""Going against a guy like Tom is a great challenge,"" Thomas told reporters, via The Athletic's Jeff Zrebiec. ""You always want to go against a champion. It's champion on champion, so I'm excited to go against him.""

Thomas does have a Super Bowl ring from his 2013 season with the Seahawks. But in addition to that championship, Thomas admitted facing Brady will be another highlight of his career.

""I'm going to be able to tell my son, 'Look, this is what your pops did,' "" Thomas said, via Zrebiec.

""I can't wait to (pour) me up a cup of Crown (Royal) and talk to my son about it. This is part of the story, part of the legacy.""

The Patriots are hoping Thomas has to pour a stiffer drink while reminiscing about Sunday's game. But the Ravens should give New England its toughest test yet, especially if Thomas is roaming the secondary: Baltimore has allowed 17 points or fewer in each of its last two games, with Thomas playing 100 percent of defensive snaps in both contests.

Apple introducing new silver/black Magic accessories for upcoming Mac Pro,"Apple‚Äôs Mac Pro is still slated to ship sometime this fall and a new image asset shows off new Apple Magic accessories including a keyboard in silver and black without the numpad. So far, Apple has only made its space gray Magic Keyboard in the larger variant that includes the number keypad.

Discovered by Steve Troughton-Smith, a new image asset shows off the upcoming silver and black accessories for the Mac Pro that were first shown at WWDC. Not only will these look great with the Mac Pro but should also pair perfectly with Apple‚Äôs other silver finishes for its MacBook, iMacs and even iPad Pro.

When Apple first launched the space gray Magic Keyboard, Trackpad, and Mouse, it was only available with the iMac Pro. Later on, it began selling them as standalone accessories. But it still hasn‚Äôt made a space gray Magic Keyboard without the numpad.

Notably, at WWDC when Apple first announced the Mac Pro, it showed off the desktop and upcoming Pro Display XDR with the silver and black keyboard with number keypad. The new image reveals that we‚Äôre likely getting a Magic Keyboard in a color other than silver and white without the numpad.

We‚Äôre not sure what Apple will do with the new silver and black Mac Pro accessories but hopefully, they‚Äôll be available on their own, at least at some point. In any case, it‚Äôs awesome to see both a numpad and non-numpad version of the new finishes.

Shell profits hit by fall in oil prices,"Royal Dutch Shell has continued the industry trend of comfortably beating profit estimates, while also warning investors that returns might be less generous than they had hoped. 


            
            
                    
            Shell‚Äôs adjusted net income for the third quarter was well above even the highest analyst estimate as its integrated gas and oil trading churned out cash. However, the energy giant warned that the pace of share buybacks could slow due to ‚Äúprevailing weak macroeconomic conditions‚Äù.


            
            
                    
            It‚Äôs a performance that echoes Shell‚Äôs closest rival BP, which also posted better-than-expected earnings but disappointed shareholders hoping for a dividend increase. 


            
            
                    
            The third quarter was a difficult period for energy producers, with crude prices sinking over worries about the economic impact of the US-China trade war while natural gas markets are enduring a long stretch of oversupply.


            
            
            
                                                                                                                                            
            Uncertainty
‚ÄúOur earnings reflect the resilience of our market-facing businesses and their ability to capitalise on market conditions, including very strong trading and optimisation results this quarter,‚Äù Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said in a statement. ‚ÄúOur intention to buy back $25 billion in shares and reduce net debt remains unchanged,‚Äù but there‚Äôs some uncertainty over whether it will be completed within the 2020 timeframe, he said. 


            
            
                    
            Shell said adjusted net income was $4.77 billion (‚Ç¨4.28bn) in the quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.92 billion. That compares to profit of $5.62 billion in the same period last year, and improves on a surprisingly weak second quarter.


            
            
                    
            Cash flow from operations including working capital, perhaps the single most important measure for Shell as it aims to distribute $125 billion to shareholders between 2021 and 2025, was $12.25 billion, little changed from a year earlier and beating analyst estimates gathered by Shell of $11.5 billion.


            
            
                    
            Shell had warned in its first ever pre-earnings ‚Äúquarterly update‚Äù that upstream production would probably dip slightly from a year earlier, though the impact of the decline may be offset by a strong performance in its market-leading liquefied natural gas trading business.


                        
            
            
                    
            The company decided to disclose more information before publishing its results following complaints its earnings were too volatile to predict.

Kylie Jenner transforms into Marilyn Monroe,"Some Halloween costumes never go out of style.

And Kylie Jenner threw it right back to 1953 as she posed as Marilyn Monroe, in the classic film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.

Posing in a version o iconic pink satin dress and gloves the blonde icon wore for her number Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend, Kylie dripped in glittering jewelry for the V magazine cover shoot.

The mom of daughter Stormi posted two images to her Instagram, captioned 'M a r i l y n' and 'Diamonds are a girls best friend...'.

For their part V defended putting Kylie on the digital cover, writing in an editorial: 'The 22-year-old‚Äôs Halloween rendition of Monroe, infused with the perfect mix of camp and glamor, won‚Äôt change the world as we know it. But our latest digital cover star is giving us ammunition with which to fill life‚Äôs quiet moments.'

Kylie has already modeled multiple costumes this week - with Wednesday's installment seeing the stunner transform into Ariel from the 1989 Disneyclassic The Little Mermaid.

Doing a rather saucy spin on the doe-eyed character, the cosmetics billionaire, 22, sizzled in an eye-popping shell bra with a slashed tail while donning a sleek red wig which cascaded over her ample cleavage to perfection.

Her midriff-baring outfit included the purple seashell bra, green tail and long shocking scarlet hair worn by Ariel in the animated movie.

The 1989 version starred Jodi Benson as the voice of Ariel, and Disney has cast Halle Bailey in the part for an upcoming live-action remake.

Keeping Up With The Kardashians star Kylie added in a bag to the look featuring Ariel's sidekick and best friend Flounder, which added a whole new dimension to the costume.

A day earlier Kylie and her buddy Anastasia Karanikolaou wore matching Playboy bunny costumes for a Halloween party, as seen on their Instagram pages.

Kylie's Ariel look comes weeks after she posted social media footage of herself showing The Little Mermaid to her one-year-old daughter.

The lip kit mogul shares her baby girl with her rapper ex-boyfriend Travis Scott, 28, whom she has tweeted she is 'on great terms' with despite the split.

Kylie fired up her Instagram a few days ago and showed her followers the Halloween costume she had selected for her little pride and joy.

Stormi was dressed in a mini facsimile of the bespoke Versace gown Kylie wore when she attended the camp-themed Met Gala in May.

Kylie, the daughter of momager Kris Jenner and transgender former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner, attended the latter's 70th birthday dinner Tuesday.

The event was held at Kardashian hot spot Nobu Malibu and included Kylie's sister Kendall Jenner and half-sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian.

Caitlyn's son Brandon Jenner was also present - but her son Brody Jenner was not, and neither was Kim and Kourtney's sister Khloe Kardashian.

Khloe and Caitlyn have had an infamously strained relationship since the publication of the latter's memoir, which included an unflattering depiction of Kris.

When the rift initially occurred, all three Kardashian sisters closed ranks around Kris against Caitlyn, but Kim and Kourtney appear to have put the matter aside.

However, an Us Weekly source claimed Caitlyn withdrew from a public engagement at a Seminole casino in Florida last week because Khloe would be there.

Kourtney's 36-year-old ex Scott Disick and his 21-year-old girlfriend Sofia Richie were also scheduled to be at the event, contributing to Caitlyn's decision.

But on Wednesday TMZ claimed that Khloe was just busy with a commercial shoot and that is why she could not attend Caitlyn's birthday dinner.

Meanwhile, Brody has confessed he was wounded that Caitlyn avoided his Indonesian wedding to Kaitlynn Carter last year.

'Honestly, it really did hurt and I would have loved to have had her there, but she had better things to do, apparently,' he said on The Hills: New Beginnings.",Not Incident
"Measles Damages Immune System, Vulnerable Other Diseases","Researchers say the measles virus can erase the immune system‚Äôs memory. Getty Images Researchers say the measles virus can erase the immune system‚Äôs memory, making a person more vulnerable to other diseases. Experts say the discovery underscores the importance of parents getting their children vaccinated. Health officials said parents who don‚Äôt make wellness appointments with doctors for their children are more likely to not vaccinate their children. One side of the vaccination debate is receiving what they consider to be a big influx of ammunition. The measles virus reportedly causes long-term damage to the human immune system, effectively deleting the body‚Äôs defenses against other viruses. That‚Äôs according to researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute in England, the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands, and other institutions. The discovery was reported today in the journal Science Immunology. According to doctors, the research adds to the importance of parents getting their children immunized. The revelation explains why children often get other infectious diseases after having measles, and comes as declining immunization rates are causing a measles comeback. Apparently, measles is bringing other diseases along for the ride. ‚ÄúMeasles is on a big upsurge throughout the world,‚Äù Amesh Adalja, MD, FIDSA, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told Healthline. ‚ÄúCountries such as the U.K. have lost their (measles) elimination status, while the U.S. saw record numbers of cases ‚Äî and narrowly avoided losing elimination status. Vaccine hesitancy has taken its toll on measles vaccine confidence, and the world is dealing with an infection that should have been controlled decades ago,‚Äù he said.

It was previously understood that measles weakens the immune system, but now researchers have determined how. During a measles infection, a person has fewer protective white blood cells. After recovery a few weeks later, the white blood cell count goes back up. But now scientists know that person is still ‚Äúmuch more susceptible to other infectious diseases,‚Äù according to the statement. Researchers looked at a group of non-vaccinated people in the Netherlands, taken before and after a 2013 measles outbreak in their community. After sequencing antibody genes from 26 children before their infection and then 40 to 50 days after their infection, the scientists found that specific immune memory cells built up against other diseases ‚Äî and were present before the measles infection ‚Äî vanished from the children‚Äôs blood, leaving them vulnerable to diseases to which they were once immune. ‚ÄúThis study is a direct demonstration in humans of ‚Äòimmunological amnesia,‚Äô where the immune system forgets how to respond to infections encountered before,‚Äù Velislava Petrova, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the study‚Äôs lead author, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe show that measles directly causes the loss of protection to other infectious diseases.‚Äù Researchers then tested the idea in ferrets, showing that a measles-like virus reduced flu antibodies in ferrets previously vaccinated against the flu. The ferrets had worse flu symptoms after having the measles-like virus. The researchers discovered measles resets the immune system to an immature state, where it‚Äôs only able to make a limited number of antibodies. Colin Russell, a professor of applied evolutionary biology at the University of Amsterdam, says measles makes the human immune system ‚Äúbaby-like.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn some children, the effect is so strong it is similar to being given powerful immunosuppressive drugs,‚Äù he said in a statement. ‚ÄúOur study has huge implications for vaccination and public health, as we show that not only does measles vaccination protect people from measles, but also protects from other infectious diseases.‚Äù

The history of the measles vaccine The measles vaccine was by John F. Enders and Dr. Thomas C. Peebles after they collected blood samples from people who had contracted the measles during a 1954 outbreak in Boston. They licensed a vaccine in 1963. The inoculation was improved in 1968 by a team led by Maurice Hilleman. That version is still in use. In 1978, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) established a goal to eliminate measles by 1982. While that didn‚Äôt happen, by 1981, reported cases were down 80 percent from the previous year. The CDC was able to declare measles eliminated ‚Äî no continuous transmission of the disease for at least 12 months ‚Äî in 2000. That was around the same time the anti-vaccination movement picked up steam, mostly in response to British doctor Andrew Wakefield‚Äôs 1998 suggestion that vaccinations cause autism. Scientists have widely debunked the allegation. Wakefield‚Äôs medical license was revoked in 2010. ‚ÄúThis study confirms what had long been suspected about the cascading effects of measles infection,‚Äù Adalja said. ‚Äú(It) shows it not to be a benign illness and underscores the need for the vaccine to prevent this sequela of infection.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis phenomenon (of measles damaging someone‚Äôs resistance to other diseases) likely explains how measles vaccination has outsized effects because, by preventing measles downstream, infections with other pathogens were prevented,‚Äù he added. As of Oct. 3, there have been of measles confirmed in 31 states in 2019. According to the CDC, ‚ÄúThis is the greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1992. More than 75 percent of the cases this year are linked to outbreaks in New York. Measles is more likely to spread and cause outbreaks in U.S. communities where groups of people are unvaccinated.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe majority of cases are among people who were not vaccinated against the measles,‚Äù according to the CDC website.

The authors of the new study said in a statement that the increase in measles cases could bring an increase in other ‚Äúdangerous infections, like flu, diphtheria or tuberculosis, even in people who were previously immune.‚Äù ‚ÄúPneumonia is the most common cause of death as a complication of measles,‚Äù Suman Radhakrishna, MD, an infectious diseases physician at CHA Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, told Healthline. ‚ÄúDiarrhea is the most common complication. Measles-induced stomatitis and diarrhea can lead to malnutrition in children. Complications with secondary infection can cause lung damage, which is often permanent,‚Äù she said. Doctors say the study shows that a measles immunization can mean so much more than just not getting measles. ‚ÄúDiscoveries such as these only highlight the critical need for all our children to be immunized,‚Äù said Sandra Elizabeth Ford, MD, the vice president of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. ‚ÄúOne could surmise from the study that if contracting measles results in diminished immune response to other diseases, then preventing measles provides a protective factor, not only from measles, but other infectious diseases as well,‚Äù she said. Catherine Troisi, PhD, MS, an epidemiologist at UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston, says doctors have known for decades about a connection between measles and deaths from other infectious diseases. ‚ÄúChildhood death rates, even before the vaccine was developed back in ‚Äô63, you could see an increase in deaths from other infectious diseases,‚Äù Troisi told Healthline. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just effective against measles. Most kids do recover, but it can be serious. Measles was a major cause of death in developing countries. (After immunizations) there was a 50 to 90 percent decrease in deaths from other diseases in developing countries,‚Äù she said.

The growth of measles isn‚Äôt only fueled by philosophical differences between doctors and anti-vaccine parents. According to Blue Cross Blue Shield, ‚ÄúFailure to attend routine well-child visits‚Äù among commercially insured children is the predominant reason for 62 percent of under-vaccinated children from 2010 to 2016. The insurance company said in a statement that these children, now 3 to 9 years old, ‚Äúare of elementary school age, putting them at greater risk when in close contact with other children in the classroom and increasing the likelihood of an outbreak.‚Äù ‚ÄúOn average, sufficiently vaccinated children completing the seven-vaccine series by 27 months of age had two more well-child visits than children who did not complete the series,‚Äù Blue Cross Blue Shield officials said in a statement.",Not Incident

"Tom Del Beccaro: Trump impeachment hearings must include Obama, Bidens ‚Äì Republicans do your job","The White House releases a statement defending President Trump against Democrats' 'illegitimate' impeachment probe after the House approves rules for the inquiry; John Roberts has more on the reaction.




It‚Äôs official now. Democrats are careening toward the impeachment of a president and dragging the American people along with them. In today‚Äôs mass media age, it will consume this nation like few other events ever have.
I outlined a broader strategy for the GOP in my recent article for Fox News Opinion: ‚ÄúRepublicans must win the impeachment trial ‚Äì and they can by following these five steps.‚Äù
At this point, the formal House vote deprives the Republicans the right to subpoena witnesses without the permission of Adam Schiff ‚Äì the man who has repeatedly lied to the American people. That is a stark departure from the procedure that was afforded the minority party under Nixon and Clinton.
JASON CHAFFETZ: OBAMA WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPEACHED UNDER STANDARDS DEMOCRATS ARE APPLYING TO TRUMP
If the Republicans are serious about winning this truly political fight, here are three witnesses they should demand be subpoenaed:
Hunter Biden 
Joe Biden
Barack Obama.

Before we talk about them, you might ask the question: What is an impeachable offense?
The Constitution explicitly states: ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.""  That is the easy part when it comes to presidents.  Treason and bribery are easily defined but ‚Äúother high Crimes and Misdemeanors‚Äù are not.
Did those words refer to a president challenging a suspect law passed by a Congress seeking to determine who could serve in a president‚Äôs cabinet? In 1868, a Republican-dominated House of Representatives impeached Democratic President Andrew Johnson, with an overwhelming vote of 126 to 47, for just that. The Senate, however, never convicted Johnson.
Johnson‚Äôs acts related to his exercise of official presidential powers.  The Nixon impeachment proceedings started based on the ill-famed Watergate break-in and a subsequent cover-up.  Nixon‚Äôs acts were a combination of private acts and executive power.
Bill Clinton you ask?  Well, that was based on his perjurous statement to a federal grand jury and obstruction of justice in a private lawsuit against him ‚Äì largely private actions thought far too unfit for a president by the Republican House. The Senate did not convict Clinton either.
So, does the above enable you to determine whether the Trump Ukraine phone call is worthy of impeachment? Certainly not.
In truth, impeachment is far more political than legal. It is, as former House member President Gerald Ford once said, ""Whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.""
As long as we are considering precedent, however, we should compare the acts of President Trump, for which he is accused, to those of a prior president‚Äôs administration that actually did that which the Democrats accuse President Trump of doing.
You see, the Obama administration clearly engaged with Ukraine starting in January of 2016.  As investigative reporter John Solomon tells us, the Obama White House ‚Äúsummoned‚Äù Ukrainian authorities under false pretenses.
The January 2016 gathering, confirmed by multiple participants and contemporaneous memos, brought some of Ukraine‚Äôs top corruption prosecutors and investigators face to face with members of former President Obama‚Äôs National Security Council (NSC), FBI, State Department and Department of Justice (DOJ).
The agenda suggested the purpose was training and coordination. But Ukrainian participants said it didn‚Äôt take long ‚Äî during the meetings and afterward ‚Äî to realize the Americans‚Äô objectives included two politically hot investigations: one that touched Vice President Joe Biden‚Äôs family and one that involved a lobbying firm linked closely to then-candidate Trump.
Of course, that was when candidate Trump was on the ascent.  It is also important to note that Ukraine was seeking aid from the Obama administration at that time.
Then, as Solomon tells us, which narrative is largely confirmed by Politico, ‚ÄúIn March 2016, a contractor for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) pressed his embassy to try to find any Russian dirt on Trump and Manafort that might reside in Ukraine‚Äôs intelligence files. The DNC contractor also asked Chaly's team to try to persuade Ukraine‚Äôs president at the time, Petro Poroshenko, to make a statement disparaging Manafort when the Ukrainian leader visited the United States during the 2016 election.‚Äù
You can plainly see that the Obama administration sought to involve Ukraine in the 2016 election. The March 2016 requests were declined by Ukraine on the basis that it would involve them in the U.S. election. In that same month, Joe Biden famously forced Ukraine to fire a prosecutor in exchange for aid.
We also know that the Biden investigation in Ukraine died and that Ukraine handed over information on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort that led to his embarrassing resignation.
Quid pro quo.
Now, it would seem to me that those acts of the Obama administration are far more serious than the accusations against President Trump.
A Democrat in Congress might say Trump‚Äôs acts were for his personal political gain and that makes a difference.  But, let‚Äôs be serious.  Obama wanted to see Trump defeated at the ballot box and to have the Biden investigation in Ukraine quashed because the truth would hurt his legacy. It‚Äôs a safe bet to say that he could expect that Trump would unwind the Obama legacy.
In any case, the actions of the Obama administration are documented.  Now that the impeachment inquiry in the House is officially underway, Joe Biden, under oath, should be brought in to tell the truth about why he did what he did.
Many others involved in the Obama scheme, like  Alexandra Chalupa, an American working with the DNC, whom Politico says was part of an effort ‚Äúto research connections between Trump, Manafort and Russia,‚Äù should be subpoenaed as well.

After they have sufficiently tied them down on the record, former President Obama should also be subpoenaed. Let him try to deny the facts that will have been so well documented.
All in all, the PRECEDENT of their actions ‚Äì which did NOT lead to the impeachment of Biden and Obama is STRONG evidence of the meaning of an impeachable offense that must be entered into trial ‚Äì and placed into the hands of Americans long before the impeachment.  When it is, Trump can easily be acquitted for acts that simply don‚Äôt compare to those of the Obama administration.
Bill Clintons‚Äô reelection request for aid from Britain‚Äôs former Prime Minister Tony Blair also should be explored while the Republicans are at it. Yesterday‚Äôs acts do shed light on today‚Äôs.
As for Hunter Biden, his deal with Burisma was the personification of rot and, to borrow a phrase, of influence peddling.  He got millions for attending a handful of meetings because of his father‚Äôs name. His appearance could well end Joe Biden‚Äôs career once and for all.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Will the Democrats allow them to be subpoenaed?  If they don‚Äôt, Republicans can say to America they are hiding the truth and railroading a President and our Constitution.  If they allow it, the truth will finally come forth.
Overall, the Republicans can prove to America what truly is afoot in Washington.  By point to past precedents they can prove that Trump is innocent. To do that, however, they cannot be shy.  They must be bold ‚Äì no less bold than our founders who laid down the gauntlet for the corrupt acts of a king and his massive army ‚Äì who were only slightly more daunting than Nancy Pelosi is today.

Kevin Durant admits Draymond Green row influenced Golden State Warriors departure,"Kevin Durant has admitted last season's in-game argument with team-mate Draymond Green influenced his decision to leave the Golden State Warriors for the Brooklyn Nets in free agency. The Warriors were attempting to win a third straight NBA title with Durant - and fourth in five years - when an argument broke out between the pair in November 2018. Durant reportedly ranted at Green for not getting him the ball. Green responded, reportedly by calling Durant a choice name and telling him to leave the team because the Warriors were a championship-winning squad without him. ""I wish that wouldn't have happened,"" Durant told ESPN's First Take. ""I feel like that was a situation that definitely could have been avoided. It really came out of nowhere. For us, everybody [outside the team] was looking for something to tear us down with and I think they used that. ""That just brought in a firestorm where every day it was about my free agency, every day was about my disposition as a player, what I look like on the bench, what I look like in the game. It opened up a lot of nonsense that could have been avoided. And me and Draymond talked about it. ""I mean, your team-mate talks to you that way, you think about it a little bit. Like I said, we talked about it. But definitely, for sure [it was a factor in leaving]. I'm not going to lie about it."" Golden State suspended Green for one game in the aftermath, before going on to lose in the NBA Finals in June, with an Achilles injury to Durant denting their hopes. Durant elected to sign with the Brooklyn Nets over the summer, but is not expected to return to the court this season as he recovers from off-season surgery.

Max Verstappen hits back at Lewis Hamilton after 'torpedo' jibe,"Max Verstappen has accused Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel of being ""disrespectful"" and ""silly"" with their comments about his driving - but insists he's happy they are talking about him ""because that means you're in their head"".

I think it's a bit disrespectful, and I prefer to fight on track which I love to do.""But Verstappen, who eventually finished sixth in Mexico City after a spirited comeback in the Red Bull, is also taking his rivals' criticism as a positive.""From my side, it's fine,"" he claimed.

We've finally figured out what happens when a star explodes,"What happens when a star explodes? Surprisingly, the same thing that happens when gas explodes here on Earth.

For explosions to occur, there needs to be a build-up of pressure. Alexei Poludnenko at the University of Connecticut and his team wanted to find out is how this can happen in explosions that occur in open, unconfined spaces, such as type Ia supernova, which is when a small, very dense star called a white dwarf detonates.

Poludnenko and his colleagues wondered whether there were similarities between these stellar events and unconfined explosions on Earth, such as the accidental blast that occurred at the Buncefield fuel storage facility in the UK in 2005.

‚ÄúIn Buncefield there was a fuel leak and there was a fuel-air vapour cloud formed above ground,‚Äù says Poludnenko. What was unclear is how this kind of vapour cloud could hold together long enough for an explosion to occur ‚Äì the same problem as the exploding stars.

To investigate, the researchers ignited a mixture of methane and air in a lab facility and measured the pressure of the resulting explosion with sensors, while also tracking the speed of the flames using a high-speed camera. They also compared this to a computer simulation of a type Ia supernova.

They found that igniting the gas mix created fast turbulence, stirring up the flames and making the burning much more vigorous, says Poludnenko. Once the burning is fast enough, this creates pressure so quickly that it doesn‚Äôt have time to dissipate, eventually causing a detonation.

The same process seems to be behind supernova explosions, says Poludnenko.  ‚ÄúWe also see in the simulations that this happens in a star, it‚Äôs the same mechanism.‚Äù",Not Incident
"Twin Peaks Share Wistful Standalone Single ""Our World""","Twin Peaks  are hot off the release of their latest album Lookout Low, which came out this September, making the unexpected release of their latest standalone single, ‚ÄúOur World,‚Äù that much more exciting. The song leans into Twin Peaks‚Äô alt-country side with a beautiful arrangement and message‚Äîhardly a b-side.

Lookout Low marked a growth in Twin Peaks‚Äô sound as they moved into the realm of classic rock ‚Äòn‚Äô roll‚Äîwith heavy Stones influences across. ‚ÄúOur World,‚Äù in comparison, feels much more Uncle Tupelo than anything else. The track is defined by its acoustic guitar-picking and a mellow slide guitar taking the edge off. Vocalist Caiden Lake James stays in his lower register during the chorus, singing the reassuring lines, ‚ÄúNo matter what the people say / It‚Äôs still our world / I still wanna wake up.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur World‚Äù was born out of the recording sessions for Lookout Low, but stands out distinctly from the songs on the record. James explains his inspiration for writing the track and why it didn‚Äôt make the cut for the album:

One day last year amidst some moment of (the constant) political turmoil or another, I read a tweet Connor posted encouraging all that despite the current state of affairs, ‚Äúit‚Äôs still our world.‚Äù I wrote the lyrics for ‚ÄúOur World‚Äù directly after. Despite not fitting into the sequence of Lookout Low, it‚Äôs one of our favorites we recorded and we‚Äôre happy to share it now.

Twin Peak‚Äôs latest record was released this September and is available here. You can listen to ‚ÄúOur World‚Äù below, plus the band‚Äôs 2014 Daytrotter session, and find Twin Peaks‚Äô tour dates further down.

Mario Lopez's kids honor 'Saved by the Bell' for Halloween ‚Äî see the photos,"Mario Lopez is turning the upcoming ‚ÄúSaved by the Bell‚Äù reboot into a family affair this Halloween.

Lopez posted a series of photos of his kids dressed as characters from the Saturday morning show that helped their dad rocket to stardom.

‚Äú‚ÄòSaved By The Bell‚Äô the reboot!‚Äù Lopez wrote.

Daughter Gia sports the Bayside cheerleader outfit while dressed as Kelly, originally portrayed by Tiffani Thiessen, and son Dominic shows he can be as preppy as Zack, wearing acid washed jeans and a rugby shirt over a light jacket. Naturally, he also has the oversized cellphone Mark-Paul Gosselaar‚Äôs Zack used on the series.

Newborn son Santino is done up in a wrestling jersey, dressed as his dad‚Äôs character, Slater.

Heck, even their dog got into the spirit of things as Artie the chameleon, a nod to the episode in which Slater's pet chameleon dies when he goes out of town.

There are also three videos, one of which features the older kids cheering ‚ÄúBayside,‚Äù as well as Gia showing off some moves in Kelly‚Äôs cheerleading costume and another of Dominic chatting away on the aforementioned cellphone.

Lopez, 46, certainly doesn't shy away from showing his love for ""Saved by the Bell."" In January, he teamed up with Gosselaar to re-create a classic shot from the show.

The actor will revisit Slater once more when the ""Saved by the Bell"" update premieres on NBC's upcoming streaming service, Peacock.",Not Incident

            HOUSTON (AP) ‚Äî It was well within their grasp.


    
            The Houston Astros had a shot at a mini dynasty with a second title in three seasons. Instead, they failed to get one win in two chances at home against the Washington Nationals and have an offseason as runner-ups to ponder what might have been.


    
            ""I've got a group of heartbroken men ... that did everything they could to try to bring a World Series championship to this city,"" manager AJ Hinch said. ""And we fell one win shy.""


    
            The Astros won a franchise-record and MLB-best 107 games to earn home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. It didn't help in a World Series in which they dropped all four games in Houston, capped by Wednesday night's 6-2 loss that left them to watch the Nationals celebrate on their home field.


    
                                
            
                                

            
            In a season where aces Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole powered their spectacular success, a bullpen implosion in the seventh inning in Game 7 ensured the Astros wouldn't get a second ring this year.


    
            Zack Greinke, picked up at the trade deadline as the last piece to a team that seemed destined for another title, had his best outing of the postseason Wednesday night. When he was lifted with one on and one out in the seventh, Houston led by a run. Two pitches later, Howie Kendrick took Will Harris deep and the Nationals took the championship from the Astros.

                'A group of heartbroken men': Astros fall short of title

                
                
                
                    
                

            

        

    



                                    

                                
            It was an agonizing ending for a team was favored to be champions all season. In Verlander and Cole they had two front-runners for the AL Cy Young Award. Their loaded roster also boasted MVP candidate Alex Bregman and rookie of the year favorite Yordan Alvarez along with star hitters Jose Altuve, George Springer and Carlos Correa.


    
                                
            
            ""This is going to sting for a really long time, and it should,"" Hinch said. But when everything, the dust settles, we'll be very proud of the season we had, albeit one win short.""


    
            Verlander, who threw his third no-hitter this season, won 20 games for the second time in his career and first since winning a career-high 24 in 2011 with Detroit when he won the Cy Young and MVP. Cole set a team record by winning his last 16 regular-season decisions and topped the AL with a career-best 2.50 ERA. His career-high 326 strikeouts were the most in the majors and set a franchise record that had stood since 1979 when J.R. Richard fanned 313.


    
                                

            
            Bregman had 41 homers and 112 RBIs ‚Äî both career-highs ‚Äî to power Houston's offense and compete with Mike Trout for AL MVP honors. Alvarez started the season in Triple-A before a June call-up. He had 27 homers and 78 RBIs in just 87 games.


    
                                            
                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                

                    
            But those gaudy numbers and all the hardware Houston players might receive this offseason won't make what happened Wednesday night sit any better. The Astros entered the season saying their only goal was another championship.


    
            ""It stings, and it's going to sting for a little bit, but after that, it kind of washes away,"" Springer said. ""We know the feeling of success, which we had. We know the feeling of failure, which we now had. You build on it and take that into next year.""


    
            Houston won 100 games for the third straight season and should be in good position to maintain that success next year with most of its core returning. They're likely, however, to lose one big piece from this year's run. Cole becomes a free agent and expected to command at least a $200 million contract, which could be too rich for the Astros.


    
            Still, the Astros believe they remain built for sustained success.


    
            ""We will have more opportunities to win the World Series, play in the postseason,"" Bregman said. ""This team was amazing with 107 wins. I think this team will bounce back from this and come ready to play next year.""

Schools are facing more cyberattacks than ever before,"Cyberattacks against schools have increased dramatically and this year has already seen almost as many incidents as the previous two years combined, according to Barracuda which analyzed data compiled by the K-12 Cybersecurity Resource Center (k-12 CRC) which has been tracking reported attacks against schools since 2016.

So far in 2019, there have been 301 attacks against schools compared to 124 in 2018 and 218 in 2017. However, these figures only account for reported cases and it is highly likely that additional cases either went unreported or even undetected as stealthy malware is used to steal information, participate in botnets or mine cryptocurrency.

In a recently published report from the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), it was revealed that 83 percent of 430 schools across the UK had experienced at least one cybersecurity incident even though 98 percent of schools used antivirus software and 99 percent had some sort of firewall protection.

By using a single source of open threat intelligence data a list of all known websites belonging to US and UK schools, researchers from Barracuda found 234 unique malware samples that tried to connect to school domain names. The firm also found 123 IP addresses with the same set of schools that had a negative reputation which could point to additional malicious activity.

Barracuda's research found that data breaches (31%), malware (23%), phishing (13%), network or school infrastructure hacks (10%) and denial-of-service attacks (4%) were the most common threats targeting schools.

There are a number of reasons behind this increase in cyberattacks against schools including the fact that many school districts only have one or two IT personnel with no dedicated cybersecurity staff. The increase in school-issued devices in recent years is another factor as it has drastically expanded the attack surface along with the number of systems which need to be secured.

Phishing accounted for 13 percent of the incidents reported to the K-12 Cybersecurity Resource Center. However, the real number of phishing related incidents is probably much higher as phishing is unlikely to be reported in a school setting unless an incident occurs as a result or the campaign is large enough to warrant attention.

To better protect against cyberattacks, Barracuda recommends that schools increase their perimeter security through network firewalls, web filters and email protection, internal network security by keeping up with security patches and their incident response capabilities. Maintaining a capable IT security staff is also an essential step to preventing cyberattacks in the first place.",Not Incident
Cat Throws Perfectly Reasonable Tantrum Over Unoriginal Owner Who Dressed as Cat,"Halloween is a hoot until someone steals your look. At least that‚Äôs the takeaway from a video of a ticked off cat circulating the internet.

There is nothing more frustrating than putting in the time and effort to come up with a clever Halloween costume‚Äîonly to show up at a party and realize that someone else dressed up as an Area 51 alien, *NSYNC-era Justin Timberlake, or Kylie Jenner singing ‚Äúrise and shine‚Äù.

In the video, the cat is just chilling out at home when its owner suddenly revealed her idea for a Halloween costume‚Äîgoing as a cat. The cat took one look at the girl in her cat ears and drawn-on whiskers and instantly knew that costume was not okay.

The owner may not have realized that stealing the cat‚Äôs look and appropriating it for a ‚Äúfun‚Äù Halloween costume was wrong, but she quickly recognized her mistake when the cat put its ears back and did the feline version of glaring, shaking its head, and walking away. The owner realized the error of her ways, rectified the situation, and removed the faux cat ears. Luckily, her furry friend was willing to forgive and chalk this up as a learning experience in exchange for a few chin scritches.

Motor Rally: World champion Tanak quits Toyota for Hyundai,"PARIS: Newly-crowned world rally champion Ott Tanak signed a two-year deal to drive for Hyundai on Thursday (Oct 31), just four days after wrapping up his maiden title with Japanese manufacturer Toyota.
The 32-year-old Estonian spent two seasons with Toyota but will now join Thierry Neuville, the championship runner-up in 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2018, for a full season while Dani Sordo and nine-time world champion Sebastien Loeb will share the third car throughout next year.

    




""I am really excited to join Hyundai Motorsport from the 2020 WRC season,"" said Tanak.
""It's a big honour for me to have the opportunity to join the team at this exciting stage of our respective careers. I have big respect for what Hyundai has accomplished, we've been fighting closely against each other for a number of seasons.""
The 14-round 2020 world rally championship gets under way in Monte Carlo from Jan 23-26 and ends in Japan from Nov 19-22.

""Ott (and co-driver Martin Jarveoja) will enable us to continue to be at the forefront for the coming years. He is an exceptional talent, as we have all seen, impressively quick and consistent on all terrains and he will be a real asset to Hyundai Motorsport.""",Not Incident
Asthma Patients Could Slash Their Carbon Footprint By Switching To 'Greener' Inhalers,"(CNN) ‚Äî 
Asthma sufferers could sharply reduce their carbon footprint by swapping commonly used inhalers for ‚Äúgreener‚Äù alternatives, a study from the University of Cambridge has found.

By swapping metered-dose inhalers for dry powder inhalers, users could reduce their carbon emissions equivalent to reducing their meat consumption or recycling, researchers said Wednesday.

But patients have been warned not to make such changes without medical advice.

Inhalers are used to treat the symptoms of conditions such as asthma by releasing medicine straight into a patient‚Äôs lungs, widening the airways and making it easier to breathe.

Metered-dose inhalers contain liquified, compressed gas hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) ‚Äî a greenhouse gas ‚Äî which acts as a propellant to atomize the drug being delivered and to pump it out to the user.

Seven out of 10 of the 50 million inhalers prescribed in England in 2017 were metered-dose inhalers.

Researchers found that these metered-dose inhalers contribute 3.9% of the carbon footprint of the UK‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS).

Alternative ‚Äúgreener‚Äù treatments, such as dry powder inhalers and aqueous mist inhalers, are available, experts said in the study published in BMJ Open.

But the higher up-front price of some dry powder inhalers was a ‚Äúsignificant barrier‚Äù when moving to such alternatives.

Researchers found that the carbon footprints of metered-dose inhalers were up to 37 times those of dry powder inhalers.

Replacing 10% of metered-dose inhalers in England with the cheapest dry powder equivalents would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 58 kilotonnes of CO2, the scientists said.

Researchers also found that an individual could save the equivalent of between 150 and 400 kilograms of CO2 a year by using ‚Äúgreener‚Äù alternatives ‚Äî similar to the effect of reducing meat consumption, recycling, or installing wall insulation.

An estimated 235 million people suffer from asthma worldwide, according to figures from the World Health Organization, and the condition is the most common chronic disease among children.

‚ÄúClimate change is a huge and present threat to health that will disproportionately impact the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet, including people with pre-existing lung disease,‚Äù James Smith, a consultant in public health at the University of Cambridge and author of the study, said in a statement.

‚ÄúOur study shows that switching to inhalers which are better for the environment could help individuals, and the NHS as a whole, reduce their impact on the climate significantly. This is an important step towards creating a zero carbon healthcare system fit for the 21st century,‚Äù he added.

However, the researchers warned that people with asthma should not stop using their regular medication, but should instead discuss their options with a medical professional.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important to stress that patients shouldn‚Äôt stop using their usual treatments to reduce their carbon footprint,‚Äù Alexander Wilkinson, respiratory medicine consultant and author of the study, said.

‚ÄúInstead we recommend patients review their condition and treatment at least annually with their healthcare professional and at this point discuss whether a more environmentally-friendly inhaler is available and appropriate in their situation.‚Äù

Experts warned that switching to a different type of inhaler must not come at the expense of asthma sufferers‚Äô health.

‚ÄúWe recognize the need to protect the environment, but it‚Äôs critically important that people with asthma receive the medicines they need to stay well and avoid a life-threatening asthma attack,‚Äù Jessica Kirby, Head of Health Advice at Asthma UK, said in a statement.

‚ÄúSwitching to a different type of inhaler can be complicated for people with asthma, as it involves learning a new inhaler technique, so it should only be done with support from a GP or asthma nurse,‚Äù she added.

"Keystone Pipeline Does as Experts Predicted, Spills 383,000 Gallons of Oil in North Dakota","WASHINGTON - Yesterday, the Keystone pipeline leaked an estimated 383,000 gallons (9,120 barrels) of oil into wetlands in North Dakota. The leak is already the eighth-largest pipeline oil spill of the last decade. The tar sands oil transported through the Keystone pipeline is particularly hard to clean up because, unlike crude oil, it sinks in water.

Keystone operator TC Energy‚Äôs (formerly TransCanada) alarming spill and safety record has come under scrutiny as it attempts to build the controversial and much larger Keystone XL pipeline through the midwestern United States and Indigenous treaty lands.

‚ÄúI wish I could say I was shocked, but a major spill from the Keystone pipeline is exactly what multiple experts predicted would happen. In fact, this is the fourth significant spill from the Keystone pipeline in less than ten years of operation. History has shown us time and again that there is no safe way to transport fossil fuels, and pipelines are no exception. In the last ten years, US pipeline spills have led to 20 fatalities, 35 injuries, $2.6 billion in costs, and more than 34 million gallons spilled. New pipelines are locking us into carbon emissions that will push our climate past safe limits. That is not the future I want for my children.

""In the past decade, every proposed tar sands pipeline ‚Äî including the Keystone XL pipeline ‚Äî has been stopped or delayed by a powerful movement fighting for Indigenous rights, a clean energy economy, and our environment. It is past time to leave fossil fuels in the ground and begin a just transition to a Green New Deal and 100 percent renewable energy.""

Greenpeace analysis from 2017 estimates that, if completed, the Keystone XL pipeline could expect 59 significant spills over a 50-year lifetime. With this latest spill, TC Energy has seen a total of 20 spills from its US pipeline network since 2010, which have released 696,276 gallons (16,578 barrels) of oil and hazardous liquids into the environment.

While Donald Trump moved to ‚Äúfast-track‚Äù the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in his first month in office, multiple Democratic frontrunners have already come out against the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure.",Not Incident
For the Record' Podcast: Steven Ivory & Lee Bailey Catch Michael Henderson a 2nd Time; They Have Thoughts,"*This latest episode of our EURweb podcast For the Record takes us back for a second dose of R&B musician/singer/songwriter Michael Henderson.

The artist best known for his early 70s classics ‚ÄúWide Receiver,‚Äù ‚ÄúValentine Love‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Are My Starship‚Äù returned to the Catalina Jazz Club in Los Angeles this month, and so did EUR creator and For the Record host Lee Bailey and his longtime buddy, music journalist/historian Steven Ivory.

As they did back in July after Henderson‚Äôs first show, the duo took their thoughts about the concert to the podcast ‚Äì basking, again, in memories of that old-school musicianship that Henderson brings, and that appears to be lost among today‚Äôs R&B superstars.

Ivory was again blown away by the musician, but less impressed with the execution this time, partly due to a different backing band. He told Bailey: ‚ÄúIf you were really paying attention, it was almost a damn train wreck. Because some guys were missing turnarounds, and you could hear him directing. The uninitiated members of the audience probably didn‚Äôt know that sometimes when he started singing the bass line ‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs looking back at the bass player, saying, ‚ÄòThis is where I want you to go with this.'‚Äù

But Ivory made clear, ‚Äúconsidering the fact that he was guiding this band through some of these songs right there on stage, just how remarkably wonderful his stuff sounded.‚Äù

Ivory compares Henderson to Prince and Jermaine Jackson among guitar/bass players who also sing lead. He equates that unique skill with trying to pat your head and rub your stomach at the same time. The bass is ‚Äúfollowing one melody and your voice is following another. Not everybody can do that.‚Äù

Ivory also talks about that time Jimmy Fallon mocked Henderson‚Äôs hit ‚ÄúWide Receiver,‚Äù explains why he considers the song a ‚Äúnovelty‚Äù hit, drops in a Ron Isley anecdote and much more. Listen to the entire conversation in our latest episode of For The Record, below.",Not Incident

Commons Speaker John Bercow leaves the chamber,"Commons Speaker John Bercow has left the chamber for the last time day, after a tetchy final session in the chair.

The 56-year-old stepped down from the helm after 10 years in the job and uttered the words 'order, order', after closing proceedings for the final time.

After proceeding ceased this afternoon everyone stood for Mr Bercow as he waved his final goodbye to the house.

Tributes to his time in parliament have since been rolling in with many saying he should be 'heralded' for his contributions.

This morning Bercow stopped to pose for photographs as he crossed Westminster Bridge this morning and let a commuter take a selfie with him with the Houses of Parliament in the background.

Meanwhile a collection of previously-unreleased photographs of Mr Bercow over the past year emerged today of him at a reception after the Queen's Speech, speaking to college students from North Wales and meeting a Muslim community in North London.

A replacement for Mr Bercow will be elected in due course - with favourites including his deputy Sir Lindsay Hoyle and former deputy prime minister Harriet Harman.

He will also resign as MP for Buckingham - a seat he has held for 22 years - which will be hotly contested in the general election this December.

Mr Bercow announced his intention to stand down from the influential position in September, saying the timing was the 'least disruptive and most democratic course of action'.

He would have relinquished the role sooner if MPs had supported Boris Johnson's initial attempt for an early general election in September.

Mr Bercow entered Parliament in 1997 and held several shadow ministerial positions before taking the Speaker's chair on June 22 2009, promising to serve 'no more than nine years in total'.

He abandoned that commitment ahead of the 2017 snap election, but allegations of bullying by former members of his staff, denied by the Speaker, led to fresh calls for him to quit.

In recent months he has also come under fire for a series of controversial rulings in the chamber which were widely considered to favour Remain supporters.

John Bercow was Speaker for more than ten years. Here are some of his more controversial moments: Mr Bercow risked angering Tory MPs by revealing he was a supporter of the hunting ban to one of his constituents. The Speaker said he agreed hunting foxes to kill them was 'wrong in the 21st century' amid calls for the ban to be repealed in 2011.  Mr Bercow's wife was thrown into the spotlight when she posed for London's Evening Standard wearing nothing but a bed sheet. Sally Bercow described the 'aphrodisiac' effect of their life at the Palace of Westminster and described the view from the Speaker's House as 'incredibly sexy'. But in 2015 she said he hated living in Parliament, describing it as a 'goldfish bowl' amid reports of trouble in the couple's marriage when she admitted being a 'terrible wife'. Mr Bercow's use of expenses has also raised eyebrows - particularly as he took office at the height of the scandal over Westminster perks. He racked up a ¬£172 bill being chauffeur-driven to a conference just 0.7 miles from Parliament. He also spent ¬£367 taking a car to Luton to deliver a speech on how MPs were restoring their reputation after the expenses scandal. Mr Bercow spent thousands of pounds wining and dining fellow MPs - including more than ¬£2,000 on a 'standing down' dinner for his former deputy. A taxpayer-funded ¬£37,000 portrait of the Speaker led to accusations of 'vanity'. The official painting, by British artist Brendan Kelly, joined those of his predecessors going back to Sir Thomas More and featured a new coat of arms developed for Mr Bercow. The Speaker was criticised for voicing his opposition to the suggestion that US President Donald Trump might address Parliament during a 2017 state visit. Introducing Chinese Premier Xi Jinping ahead of his address to Parliament in 2015, Mr Bercow said the Asian superpower should be a 'moral inspiration' and 'the world will be watching' - an apparent reference to Beijing's poor human rights record. Mr Bercow faced calls to resign in January after he was found to have a 'Bollocks to Brexit' sticker in his car window. 'That sticker on the subject of Brexit happens to be affixed to or in the windscreen of my wife's car,' he explained to MPs. She is entitled to her views: that sticker is not mine - and that's the end of it.' Finally, in March, he thwarted Theresa May's attempt to bring a third meaningful vote to Parliament. He described it as 'the same proposition or substantially the same proposition' as the second.

The contest to replace Mr Bercow will take place via a secret ballot, with a result announced on the same day as voting.

He has been no stranger to the limelight in more than ten years in the Speaker's chair.

The one-time Conservative MP for Buckingham, with a high-profile Labour-supporting wife, has made a catalogue of unconventional comments since he took over the impartial role from Michael Martin.

He has survived attempts to remove him from the chair, including from former colleagues in the Tory party, revelations about his expenses and allegations of bullying, which he denied.

But it will perhaps be his interventions in the Brexit crisis, and the relish with which he seemed to make them, for which he will be best remembered.

Regular Parliament watchers may or may not miss his inimitable style, such as his bellowing shouts of 'order' and 'division, clear the lobby', but those quirks are what brought him international attention when the eyes of the world became fixed on the Commons throughout 2019.

As the Brexit debate raged and senior opposition figures played every trick in the parliamentary book to prevent the governments of Theresa May and Boris Johnson from pursuing their preferred policies, Mr Bercow drew the ire of hardline Eurosceptics for perceived bias.

After he allowed an amendment by Tory rebel Dominic Grieve to be voted on in January, he was labelled 'Speaker of the Devil' by one newspaper, while the Daily Mail called him an 'egotistical preening popinjay (who) has shamelessly put his anti-Brexit bias before the national interest - and is a disgrace to his office'.

He voted Remain, discussing it candidly with a group of students, but in an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica denied this meant he had lost his impartiality.

'If I'm biased, I'm biased in favour of Parliament. Parliament being heard. Parliament having a right to speak. Parliament having time. Parliament being respected by the government of the day and indeed by the opposition,' he said.

Since being elected as the 157th Speaker of the House of Commons in June 2009, he has delivered many caustic put-downs, earning him both loathing and appreciative laughter from MPs.

He had a fractious relationship with former Commons Leader, and now Business Secretary, Andrea Leadsom, after he was accused of calling her a 'stupid woman'.

His remarks from the chair include telling Labour's Paula Sherriff (Dewsbury) she would have received an anti-social behaviour order (Asbo) if her rowdy behaviour had taken place outside the Commons.

Who could replace John Bercow and how is a successor chosen?  John Bercow, the Commons Speaker who is as colourful as he is commanding, is to take his final seat in the chair where he has berated unruly MPs for more than 10 years. The former Tory will also step down as MP for Buckingham. With the search for a replacement afoot, here is a look at what the Speaker's role is and who may be next in line to the big green chair. - What exactly does the Speaker do? More than just yell 'orderrrrrr' at rowdy politicians. As well as maintaining discipline in the House, the Speaker is an MP who chairs debates between their colleagues. They must remain politically impartial at all times. Mr Bercow has been accused of falling foul of this over the years, particularly by Conservatives. He has also received praise for empowering backbenchers - though not from the governments trying and failing to force through Brexit legislation. - How will his successor be selected? Mr Bercow's replacement will be chosen on Monday during what is likely to be a day of drama. Candidates will hand their nominations over to the Commons Table Office in the morning, having secured the backing of at least 12 MPs, including three from a different party. A list of the nominees will go live on the Parliament website at around 11am, before MPs file into the Commons for 2.30pm to hear speeches delivered by each candidate. Then the voting begins. Each MP is handed a ballot paper and has 30 minutes to make their selection - in secret. Who voted for who will not be revealed. If a candidate gets more than half the votes then they are automatically elected. But, if not, any candidate with less than 5 per cent of the votes or the candidate who comes last will be eliminated. The process will then be repeated until someone secures more than half the votes, or one candidate remains if competitors drop out. A motion is then put to the House suggesting the selected MP as Speaker and, if agreed, the winner will take to the all-important chair. - And who is vying for the Speaker's throne? Sir Lindsay Hoyle, 62, is currently Deputy Commons Speaker. The Labour MP for Chorley is a popular and experienced figure in the House, having first been elected in the constituency in 1997. Dame Eleanor Laing, 61, also serves as Deputy Speaker. She has been a Tory MP for Epping Forest since 1997. Dame Eleanor is well-liked and respected across the House and has guided proceedings while deputising. Harriet Harman, 69, a former interim and deputy Labour leader. Ms Harman, who first became an MP in 1982, is also a former leader of the Commons. She commands a great deal of respect from across party lines. As Mother of the House - the longest continuously-serving women MP- her experience stands her in good stead. Sir Edward Leigh, 69, has been a Tory MP since 1983. An outspoken figure on the back benches, Sir Edward has championed Brexit and opposed the idea of a second referendum on leaving the EU. Sir Henry Bellingham, 64, was first elected as a Tory MP in 1983. Sir Henry said the next Speaker needs to be firm, but not 'rude'. Meg Hillier, 50, is the Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch. She has previously served as shadow energy secretary. Chris Bryant, 57, is a Labour MP who has previously been shadow and deputy leader of the Commons. He has previously spoken in favour of a second referendum on Brexit. Dame Rosie Winterton has been a Labour MP since 1997. The 61-year-old has previously been shadow leader of the Commons and has held many ministerial positions, including in transport, health and regional affairs. Shailesh Vara is a member of the hardline band of Tory Brexiteers, the European Research Group. The 59-year-old has held the North West Cambridgeshire constituency since 2005. He has held several junior government roles and had a brief spell as a minister of state at the Northern Ireland Office last year.

He made the joke in January 2017 as he sought to quieten the chamber to allow then prime minister Mrs May to respond to a question.

Later that month he was caught on microphone warning cabinet minister Sir Michael Fallon it would be 'stupid' to pick a fight with a senior MP.

He made the unguarded comment after the then defence secretary had been grilled about reports that a Trident ballistic missile veered off course during a test firing.

Mr Bercow has suggested yoga to several MPs, including Labour's Tom Blenkinsop (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) and Ronnie Campbell (Blyth Valley), while calling for calm during heated debates.

He admonished MPs for repeatedly asking for a tea break or whether they could use the toilet during a long-running Brexit debate.

His decision to strip parliamentary officials of their traditional wigs in 2017 was met with disapproval from a number of MPs.

In the last few years he has faced scrutiny of his expenses. In November 2015 it was revealed he had spent almost ¬£20,000 of taxpayers' money to fly to a conference in Japan with an aide.

In February 2016 a PA freedom of information request revealed that he spent thousands of pounds wining and dining fellow MPs, plus almost ¬£2,000 on a dinner with his Australian counterpart and hundreds of pounds to tune the grand piano in his apartments.

His office argued that the overall expenditure of the Speaker's Office had fallen during his tenure, from ¬£626,029 in 2009/10 to ¬£504,737 in 2015/16.

Born on January 19 1963, the son of a Jewish taxi driver, Mr Bercow went to school in Margaret Thatcher's Finchley constituency and first got involved as politics as a teenager.

He attended Essex University, where he gained a reputation as something of a firebrand, and became a member of the hardline Tory Monday Club, notorious for its 'hang Nelson Mandela' slogans, joining its Immigration and Repatriation Committee.

At the age of 20 he left the pressure group, saying some of its members' views about immigration were 'unpalatable'.

After a short spell at Hambros Bank, Mr Bercow embarked on a career as a lobbyist, serving as a councillor in Lambeth, south London, at the same time.

At the 1992 general election he stood unsuccessfully against Labour's Dawn Primarolo in Bristol South.

Three years later he went into politics full-time, becoming special adviser to chief secretary to the treasury Jonathan Aitken until his resignation, and then to heritage secretary Virginia Bottomley.

Mr Bercow finally secured a berth in the safe seat of Buckingham, and, despite Labour's landslide victory, entered Parliament at the 1997 general election.

He was made shadow chief secretary when Iain Duncan Smith became Tory leader in 2001 before quitting the Conservative front bench in November 2002.

He became Speaker following Labour MP Mr Martin's resignation and was re-elected twice, despite angering former Tory colleagues with his behaviour in the chair.

Nadine Dorries, his constituency near neighbour, was one of a handful of MPs who tried to have him removed in 2010. He was re-elected in 2015.

Mr Bercow married Sally Illman in 2002 and they have three children together.

The marriage has been a source of attention throughout his tenure, with his wife becoming a household name after posing for a photoshoot in Speaker's House draped in a sheet, and appearing on Celebrity Big Brother.

In 2015 she admitted she had been a 'terrible wife' amid reports of an affair with her husband's cousin.

Attention will now turn to what Mr Bercow will do next, with speculation focused on him becoming a reality TV star.

Bookmaker Coral have him at 4/5 to be a contestant on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! and 10/1 to go on and win it.

There is also speculation that he will become an after-dinner speaker, with Ladbrokes offering odds of 1/10 on that career move taking place in the next 12 months.

William Hill is offering odds of 1/1 that Mr Bercow will have a number one selling book before the end of 2020, 20/1 that he will be the next Prime Minister, and 100/1 that he will be the next mayor of London.",Not Incident
"Why your computer, not your smartphone, is the key to big Black Friday purchases","When you‚Äôre searching through deals, it‚Äôs likely you‚Äôre doing so on mobile or desktop ‚Äì over the last few years, shopping trends have massively skewed towards buying products online rather than in person, as it‚Äôs easier to shop on the go or when you‚Äôre bored in a meeting.

On top of that, mobile shopping is gradually gaining ground on desktop browsing, and now new data has come out that explores how people spend their money online over Black Friday.

This data comes from , which conducted a report on holiday shopping trends, including Black Friday, and Christmas. Included are a few stats regarding online shopping, comparing mobile and desktop purchases, and it might help you decide how to shop over the Black Friday season.

One of the most notable stats from Adobe‚Äôs report explored what platform you use to make big or small purchases, and the result is revealing. Adobe found that people shopping on desktops had ‚Äòcarts‚Äô that were 28% more expensive than on phones.

By ‚Äòcarts‚Äô we mean the entire basket when you reach the checkout, and this usually came from people buying more expensive products on a desktop, with phones reserved for cheaper items.

The divide between purchase sizes is, according to Adobe, because shopping on a computer makes it a lot easier to do research around your product ‚Äì for example, you might buy some new shirts on your phone because you only need to see the picture to know how good they are for you, but if you‚Äôre looking to buy a new TV, it‚Äôs worth doing more thorough research to see if it's worth lots of your hard-earned money.

If you‚Äôre in the latter camp and want to make a big purchase that you‚Äôve researched for, you‚Äôre in the right place. TechRadar gives expert reviews on all the best product in any given tech category, so search around our site to research the best laptop, smartphone, TV, games console, speaker or more.

Another reason people may prefer computers over desktop is because Adobe found people considered desktop checkouts easier to use than mobile ones, which encouraged people to hunt down the best deals on mobile but actually make the purchase from the comfort of their mouse and keyboard.

At the moment, roughly 54% online sales are on desktop compared to just 38% on smartphone (and the rest on tablet) according to Adobe, but more stats show this could change very soon.

The report suggests that of all the new spending in 2019, compared to 2018, three quarters of it will be done on smartphones. That‚Äôs $14bn of the roughly $19bn new money spent that wasn‚Äôt changing hands last year ‚Äì a significant amount.

Note that we refer to ‚Äòspending‚Äô rather than purchases. This is because only half of new purchases will be made from phones. What does this mean? Well, it seems people will be making a few more purchases, but spending a lot more money, suggesting these will be more expensive products.

So while traditionally people have used computers to make bigger purchases, this could be changing in 2019.

Checking for Black Friday deals on your phone has one advantage that might make it preferable for you ‚Äì according to Adobe‚Äôs statistics, it takes you a lot less time on a phone to find that great Black Friday bargain compared to on desktop (and, of course, in real life too).

When you‚Äôre checking for Black Friday deals now, you'll spend 11% less time compared to 2016, and you‚Äôll visit 16% fewer different pages. Despite this, spending-per minute is a whopping 63% higher now.

Clearly websites have found ways to be more efficient when it comes to marketing their discounted products, putting them front and center so people can see them better. Also, with more website creating mobile-specific user interfaces and smartphone use getting more ingrained in our culture, it‚Äôs likely it‚Äôs just easier to navigate the web on a phone too.

It‚Äôs different news for social media though, because while there are loads of great social media pages to follow for deals , and people will follow links that are posted, they won't usually spend money as a result. Roughly 11% of visits to deals pages comes from social media posts, which is triple that of 2016, however only about 4% of actual revenue came from these posts.

It‚Äôs clear then that people aren‚Äôt as influenced by influencers as we‚Äôd believe, especially given that 57% of people admitted they‚Äôd got purchase inspiration from social media, but only 20% actually made purchases based on this. Is influencer culture a bit of a fad then? Over Black Friday it is, at least.

In the next few years, phone spending could trump desktop spending ‚Äì in fact, Adobe estimates this could happen by Christmas 2019 ‚Äì and with it our spending habits change too. It‚Äôs worth checking out the then, so you can fully understand how your platform of choice pushes you to spend in different ways.",Not Incident
Jose Mourinho explains stance on taking next job amid Arsenal and Unai Emery links,"Jose Mourinho has explained the criteria that needs to be met for his return to management.
The Portuguese is slowly approaching a year out of work following his dismissal from Manchester United last December.
He has recently been linked with a surprise move to Arsenal with Unai Emery under increasing pressure to win over Gunners supporters.
It‚Äôs a rumour that has raised plenty of eyebrows given Mourinho‚Äôs long-running rivalry with former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger.

However the former Chelsea boss has now declared he knows exactly what he wants from his next job.
He told The Coaches‚Äô Voice: ‚ÄúThe only thing that I know is what I don‚Äôt want, and what I don‚Äôt want is crystal clear.
‚ÄúWhat I want, the general profile of course, but I can‚Äôt say clubs or countries.
‚ÄúI am quite pathological in this sense that I have to play to win, and then if I win or I don‚Äôt win that‚Äôs my problem, and the players‚Äô and the club‚Äôs and the structure.

‚ÄúBut I need a project where the feeling is I play to win.
‚ÄúIf someone gives me a wonderful, incredible, amazing, 10-year contract and tells me ‚Äòthe objective of the team is to stay in the first part of the table, if you finish seventh or eighth or ninth it is perfect, that‚Äôs not for me.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my nature. Of course, sometimes I remember what I won before, but it‚Äôs not me, so my next is to fight to win.‚Äù
Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas sent shockwaves through world football earlier this month when he revealed Mourinho had turned down the Ligue 1 club because he‚Äôd already found his next job.

‚ÄúWe [Aulas and Mourinho] had some fairly flattering exchanges over SMS. It was nice for everyone,‚Äù Aulas revealed.
‚ÄúHe did not accept our proposal to meet because he has already chosen another club.‚Äù
There have also been reports linking Mourinho with a return to Real Madrid, but Zinedine Zidane‚Äôs job remains safe for the meantime.
Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have also been earmarked as potential destinations, but for now Mourinho is continuing to get his football fix through punditry with Sky Sports.",Not Incident

Republicans stay loyal to Trump as House of Representatives votes to legitimise impeachment proceedings against him,"Trench warfare is now the only business in this town. In fact, on Thursday the trenches were further fortified. The bunkers were reinforced. Weapons are being loaded. Impeachment won‚Äôt be fought on open ground but from the narrow confines of party loyalties.


That is to say, one of the great spectacles of American democracy is underway.





  For the third time in modern American history, Congress is engaged in impeachment proceedings and the House of Representatives has now voted to legitimise - and accelerate - the whole process. 


Republicans have complained that Democrats are staging a coup with secret hearings intended to bring down a president. To counter that accusation, the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi called a vote to authorise the investigation.





  Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.




  The resolution was passed along party lines - 232 to 196 - with Democrats saying that American democracy and the constitution are at stake. 


Republican leaders claim that the investigation is a ‚Äúcult‚Äù and that Democrats are using Soviet-style tactics. Let‚Äôs just say, this is not a bipartisan affair.


What the vote really revealed is that there will be no mass crossing of no-man‚Äôs-land to defect to the other side. This is no Watergate, when even Republicans realised that President Nixon had to be evicted from office for the sake of American democracy. 






  This time, Republicans leaders and their core voters are sticking with Trump through thick and thin. His Senate firewall is intact, his House loyalists are digging in, and the President has been real-time tweeting from the White House, now calling this (predictably) the greatest witch-hunt in American history. Yes, impeachment has overtaken the Mueller investigation to win that status.





  So although the House will almost certainly vote to impeach the President by Christmas time, there is no appetite by the Republican-controlled Senate to convict him at the trial-stage of the process.


It requires a two-thirds majority in any case, so the possibility that Trump will be removed from office is remote. 


But impeachment shouldn‚Äôt be seen as just a ritual.  In the eyes of Democrats, it is the business of Congress to hold the President to account, and that is precisely what they intend to do.",Not Incident

How daylight saving time affects health,"Fox News Flash top headlines for Oct. 31 are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com




Office workers bemoan driving home in the dark. Night owls relish the chance to sleep in. As clocks tick toward the end of daylight saving time, many sleep scientists and circadian biologists are pushing for a permanent ban because of potential ill effects on human health.
Losing an hour of afternoon daylight sounds like a gloomy preview for the dark winter months, and at least one study found an increase in people seeking help for depression after turning the clocks back to standard time in November ‚Äî in Scandinavia. Research shows the springtime start of daylight saving time may be more harmful, linking it with more car accidents, heart attacks in vulnerable people and other health problems that may persist throughout the time change.
OKLAHOMA NEWS ANCHOR DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AFTER STREAMING FIRST-EVER MAMMOGRAM ON FACEBOOK LIVE
Here's what science has to say about a twice-yearly ritual affecting nearly 2 billion people worldwide.
SLEEP EFFECTS
Time changes mess with sleep schedules, a potential problem when so many people are already sleep-deprived, says Dr. Phyllis Zee, a sleep researcher at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago.
About 1 in 3 U.S. adults sleep less than the recommended seven-plus hours nightly, and more than half of U.S. teens don't get the recommended eight-plus hours on weeknights. One U.S. study found that in the week following the spring switch to daylight saving time, teens slept about 2.5 hours less than the previous week. Many people never catch up during the subsequent six months.
Research suggests that chronic sleep deprivation can increase levels of stress hormones that boost heart rate and blood pressure, and of chemicals that trigger inflammation.
HEART PROBLEMS
It has also been shown that blood tends to clot more quickly in the morning. These changes underlie evidence that heart attacks are more common in general in the morning, and may explain studies showing that rates increase slightly on Mondays after clocks are moved forward in the spring, when people typically rise an hour earlier than normal.
MAN NEARLY CHOKES TO DEATH ON DENTURES AFTER ACCIDENTALLY SWALLOWING THEM DURING HIS MEAL
That increased risk associated with the time change is mainly in people already vulnerable because of existing heart disease, said Barry Franklin, director of preventive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation at Beaumont Health hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan.
Studies suggest that these people return to their baseline risk after the autumn time change.
CAR CRASHES
Numerous studies have linked the start of daylight saving time in the spring with a brief spike in car accidents, and with poor performance on tests of alertness, both likely due to sleep loss.
The research includes a German study published this year that found an increase in traffic fatalities in the week after the start of daylight saving time, but no such increase in the fall.
Other studies on how returning to standard time in the fall might impact car crashes have had conflicting results.
OUR INTERNAL CLOCKS
Circadian biologists believe ill health effects from daylight saving time result from a mismatch among the sun ""clock,"" our social clock ‚Äî work and school schedules ‚Äî and the body's internal 24-hour body clock.
Ticking away at the molecular level, the biological clock is entrained ‚Äî or set ‚Äî by exposure to sunlight and darkness. It regulates bodily functions such as metabolism, blood pressure and hormones that promote sleep and alertness.
Disruptions to the body clock have been linked with obesity, depression, diabetes, heart problems and other conditions. Circadian biologists say these disruptions include tinkering with standard time by moving the clock ahead one hour in the spring.
A mismatch of one hour daily is enough for ill effects, especially if it last for several months, according to Till Roenneberg, a circadian rhythm specialist at Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, Germany.
PRESSURE TO CHANGE
In the U.S., daylight saving time runs from the second Sunday in March to the first Sunday in November. It was first established 100 years ago to save energy. Modern-day research has found little or no such cost savings.
Federal law allows states to remain on standard time year-round but only Hawaii and most of Arizona have chosen to. Proposed legislation in several states would have them join suit ‚Äî or switch to year-round daylight saving time, which would require congressional approval.

Roenneberg and Northwestern's Zee are co-authors of a recent position statement advocating returning to standard time for good, written for the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms.
""If we want to improve human health, we should not fight against our body clock, and therefore we should abandon daylight saving time,"" the statement says.",Not Incident
"Hyderabad: Society should do more, say TB survivors","Hyderabad: One of the major challenges for treatment of tuberculosis is how society treats patients struggling with numerous difficulties while recovering from the life-threatening ailment. The ongoing international summit on lung health in Hyderabad provided a platform to over 1,000 TB survivors from across the globe, to pour their heart out and share difficulties they face while fighting TB and surviving it.

Apart from making drugs affordable, support from family members, friends, relatives and society in general is vital, survivors said. ‚ÄúNobody talks about providing mental health support to TB patients. I was in my house, locked in a room for over six months while my mother used to provide me meals from the other side of the door. I could hear her sob from the other side and that made me helpless. You are automatically ostracised from society and your life gets completely messed up,‚Äù says Manasi Khade, who survived XDR-TB (Extensively Drug-Resistant TB) at the age of 19.





The girl from Maharashtra gave a powerful account of her fight against XDR-TB. ‚ÄúDue to isolation, you tend to get suicidal. Your relatives and friends stop coming and your house in the colony gets marked as a no-go zone. After treatment, many patients suffer from loss of vision and proper limb movement and such issues are never addressed,‚Äù she says.

Md Yadul, a cook by profession, successfully fought Multi-Drug Resistant TB. Due to financial difficulties, Yadul with his wife and two children lives in a single-bedroom house in Kishanbagh. The family hung a curtain over half portion of the bed so that one half can be used by Yadul and the other can be used by his wife and infant daughter.

Yadul failed TB treatment twice, which led to drug-resistant TB. ‚ÄúI was literally on the verge of death before I started to take medicines properly at Erragadda Chest Hospital. At any cost, patients must adhere to drug regimen,‚Äù he advises.

Many TB survivors said that their experiences while recovering from TB have taught them to help others.

‚ÄúAfter recovering from MDR-TB, I decided to take the message on TB awareness through folk songs and dance. Along with five others, we have formed a folk group and visit villages to spread the message,‚Äù says 33-year-old Nagabhushanam, a tribal from Khammam, who performs in a folk group.

"Clippers vs. Spurs: How to watch NBA online, TV channel, live stream info, game time","The L.A. Clippers and San Antonio are even-steven against one another since December of 2015 (both 7-7), but not for long. They will face off against one another at 10:30 p.m. ET on Thursday at Staples Center. The L.A. Clippers have seen their point totals decreasing over the past three games, a vulnerability San Antonio is surely hoping to exploit.

The contest between the Clippers and Utah on Wednesday was not a total blowout, but with the Clippers falling 110-96, it was darn close. G Patrick Beverley wasn't much of a difference maker for the L.A. Clippers; he played for 25 minutes with only eight points on 4-for-13 shooting.

Meanwhile, San Antonio came out on top in a nail-biter against Portland on Monday, sneaking past 113-110. San Antonio's success was spearheaded by the efforts of PG Derrick White, who had 21 points along with five boards, and SG DeMar DeRozan, who had 27 points along with seven boards. White didn't help his team much against Washington on Saturday, so this was a nice turnaround for him.

San Antonio's win lifted them to 3-0 while the L.A. Clippers' loss dropped them down to 3-2. A couple offensive stats to keep in the back of your head while watching: The L.A. Clippers enter the match with 51.10% field goal percentage, good for best in the league. The Spurs have displayed some offensive firepower of their own as they rank first in the league when it comes to rebounds per game, with 51.3 on average. We'll find out if either of these strengths ends up making the difference in the game.

The Clippers are a 4.5-point favorite against the Spurs.

Yankees decline Edwin Encarnaci√≥n‚Äôs 2020 option,"The New York Yankees announced today that they have declined their $20 million club option for 1B/DH Edwin Encarnaci√≥n for next season. He gets a $5 million buyout and is now the newest member of the 2019-2020 free agent class.

The move is not a shocker. Encarnaci√≥n, who turns 37 before the start of the 2020 season, missed most of the final two months of this season with an oblique injury. It wasn‚Äôt a bad season ‚Äî he hit 34 home runs drove in 86 in only 109 games and posted a line of .244/.344/.531, splitting time between the Seattle Mariners and the Yankees, to whom he was traded in June. His age, defensive limitations and the fact that he did, after all, only play in 109 games no doubt went into the decision to cut ties.

4 future workplace trends HR should understand for 2020 and beyond,"The future is coming to your HR department.

HR teams were once left out of strategic planning and mired in routine tasks and paper-dependent processes. But a myriad of developments in the economy, culture and technological landscape are changing that. Recruiting is becoming increasingly competitive and more HR technology is available every day. As a consequence, HR is becoming more critical to the company, particularly with how the future of work is developing.

Here are future workplace trends that HR teams will contend with in 2020 and beyond.

Using AI for HR is now becoming ubiquitous. Companies can use AI for recruiting, new hire onboarding, internal talent mobility and training. While the pioneers in the use of this technology were once tech companies such as IBM and Cisco, a range of nontech companies are now deploying AI. For example, Hilton Hotels is using AI for recruitment and claims to have sped up the process of replying to candidates that meet their basic requirements, according to its website. Schneider Electric is now using an AI-powered platform to provide internal talent mobility to promote career growth and employee retention, according to its website.   As we move into 2020, the question of how to use AI in an ethical and responsible manner will gain attention as a top issue. Consider the array of new laws emerging such as California's Bot disclosure law, which went into effect July 1. It requires firms to disclose when a chatbot, rather than a person, is answering questions online. This was followed by a recent Illinois law that sets new requirements for using AI for video interviews. It goes into effect Jan. 1, 2020. It requires employers to tell candidates that a company is using AI to analyze video interviews before asking them to record and submit an interview. It also requires employers to share what characteristics the interview will evaluate.

AI can radically alter how work gets done and who does it. About 25% of jobs are at risk to be mostly automated, but virtually all jobs are likely to have some parts of them automated, according to a report on automation and artificial intelligence by the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings. As AI takes over more routine tasks, employees will need to develop and refine skills that are uniquely human. Since a larger share of our economy devotes itself to service, the power soft skills now in demand include collaboration, critical thinking, communications, employee experience and design thinking. New job roles have been created in the last 10 years to use some of these creative skills, such as ""director of employee experience"" and ""director of financial wellness,"" to catch up with these future workplace trends.

As many as 375 million global workers may need to change their occupations because technology will make their jobs obsolete, according to McKinsey. The change of pace has never been this fast. Digital disruption, AI, automation of jobs and the outmoded skills are causing fundamental changes in the workplace.  Sixty-four percent of employers report a skills gap, up from 12% in 2018, according to a 2019 survey that takes a look at closing said skills gap. More than three-quarters of the surveyed 600 HR leaders claim their organization had up to 500 unfilled roles during the past year. The top barriers to filling these roles were a lack of skilled talent among current employees and an inability to find qualified job candidates. To close the skills gap, companies and their HR teams need to cast a wider net and get creative in how they source. To close the skills gap, companies and their HR teams need to cast a wider net and get creative in how they source. They will consider a more diverse talent pool, including looking for candidates who have the skills but who may not have a four-year degree. They will look to skills-based hiring, the practice of setting specific skills and create competency requirements for a job, rather than relying solely on a candidates' credentials. They will also look to technical high schools like P-TECH (a joint high school diploma and associate degree in STEM), community centers, apprenticeships and hackathons. Even today, an increasing number of Fortune 1000 companies such as Apple, Google and Netflix are recruiting candidates who do not have college degrees, a workplace trend that will only grow in the future.

Due to the evolution of HR functions in the last few years, change has been happening at an accelerated pace. E-learning has been either supplemented or replaced by virtual reality and personalized learning powered by AI, while performance management has gone from a once-a-year process to immediate feedback on an app. The movement to disrupt HR is rooted in delivering a consumer-grade employee experience in the workplace, one that mirrors the best customer experience. Employees increasingly bring their consumer expectations to the workplace. This ""employee as a consumer mindset"" requires HR to disrupt itself. HR needs to reinvent its processes to source, screen, develop and coach employees. It also needs to build new partnerships with real estate, and IT for an improved candidate and employee experience. HR can choose to welcome future workplace trends. Technology will continue to grow in importance, but perhaps counterintuitively HR can use this to deliver a workplace where people can thrive.",Not Incident

Skamania deputies say remains of missing mushroom picker found,"The Skamania County Sheriff‚Äôs Office said Thursday that an Oregon man who went missing in Gifford Pinchot National Forest nearly two weeks ago has been found dead.

"Location, location: One-of-a-kind Alpine Mountain Ranch & Club in Steamboat Springs epitomizes real estate‚Äôs golden rule","When pressed on answering why his clients purchased their mountain-modern dream home in Steamboat Springs, Chris Paoli can‚Äôt nail down one specific reason.

The unrivaled views of the South Valley, the Flat Tops, Emerald Mountain and proximity to Steamboat Ski Resort? Certainly.

The home itself ‚Äî a beautiful, mountain-contemporary design, blending bold elements that are both rustic and sleek? Yes, definitely a factor.

Unparalleled amenities, including steps-away access to the Steamboat Ski Resort gondola from the ranch‚Äôs private social club, access to fly-fishing on a stretch of the Yampa River, or miles of groomed cross country skiing and snowshoe trails out the door of your home? Yes, yes and yes.

					
				

‚ÄúThe list of reasons (for purchasing at Alpine Mountain Ranch  Club) is endless,‚Äù says Paoli, owner/broker at Colorado Group Realty. ‚ÄúMy clients are often active families, so the lifestyle-driven amenities AMRC offers check a lot of boxes.‚Äù

His most recent sale was a newly completed home at the ranch, listed at $4,495,000. The home spreads 5,700 square feet of living space across two levels. The eye-catching, mountain-contemporary design incorporates expansive glass, metal cladding and steel columns in lieu of timber to produce clean lines and a sophisticated look.

Making this home truly unique, however, is its location inside Alpine Mountain Ranch  Club, an exclusive, 1,216-acre land preservation community featuring 63 5-acre homesites and 900 acres dedicated to wildlife preserve.

‚ÄúThe Ranch is an irreplaceable asset,‚Äù says Paoli. ‚ÄúIt is a one-of-a-kind piece of land. If ‚Äòlocation, location, location‚Äô is the golden rule of real estate, AMRC is it. It backs to the ski area. It backs to the national forest. It‚Äôs only minutes from Steamboat and the ski resort. It‚Äôs a true gem of a property.‚Äù

Layering on the uniqueness of the property are the amenities provided at AMRC, which include equestrian facilities, an owners‚Äô lodge, a guest cabin and a private backcountry retreat. There‚Äôs also an on-site lake for fishing, paddleboarding or relaxing on the dock.

					
				


While this home has been scooped up, more opportunities await interested parties at AMRC.

‚ÄúThere is another spec home for sale right now, which we call Sunset Retreat,‚Äù says AMRC director of sales Suzanne Schlicht. ‚ÄúIt is of a similar size but sits in a different area of the Ranch. It also has a spectacular view corridor.‚Äù

Schlicht says they are going to continue building homes at AMRC, as the recent sale ‚Äî and a handful of others in the Steamboat area ‚Äî serves as proof that there is a market for homes at the Ranch. In fact, they are breaking ground on a new home in the near future.

‚ÄúCustomers are seeing the value in these homes,‚Äù Schlicht says. ‚ÄúPlus, the Ranch is such a special place. You‚Äôre right on the edge of Steamboat Springs, but when you‚Äôre here, you might as well be a hundred miles away.‚Äù

"Poll: Battleground States Oppose Impeaching Trump, Showing Dems Have a Desperate Fight Ahead of Them","Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, accompanied by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of Calif. and other congress members speaks during a news conference on Trump Putin Helsinki Summit at Capitol Hill in Washington on Tuesday, July 17, 2018. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)

If the Democrats are hoping impeachment will go their way, more and more evidence has come out showing that it may be a bit more damaging to them than they initially thought.

According to The Hill, swing states aren‚Äôt too keen on removing Trump from office through impeachment despite saying that an investigation is supported:

Support for impeachment is under water in new surveys of Wisconsin and Florida, two key states in next year‚Äôs fight for the White House. Trump won both in 2016, turning Wisconsin red for the first time in decades and returning Florida to the GOP column after former President Obama carried it twice. In New Hampshire and Arizona, two more swing states, most voters oppose impeachment. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton narrowly won the Granite State in 2016, and Democrats believe they have a chance to win Arizona after securing a Senate race last year. A New York Times‚ÄìSiena College battlegrounds poll released Wednesday found that majorities in Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and Florida oppose removing the president from office through impeachment. Majorities or pluralities do support an investigation of Trump, however.

In other words, uncovering the story is perfectly fine, but voters would rather not jump on board the impeachment train unless it‚Äôs warranted. If Democrats were counting on a populace that would zealously jump on the impeachment bandwagon from the get-go, they definitely aren‚Äôt getting one.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve known for a long time that everybody in California and New York want Trump to be impeached, they‚Äôve wanted that since the day he came into office,‚Äù an anonymous Trump campaign official told The Hill. ‚ÄúBut in these states where the election is really going to be fought, we‚Äôre seeing that voters oppose impeachment, and there‚Äôs an intensity to that opposition.‚Äù

Republicans have been suspicious that impeachment polling in the past has been heavily weighted due to participates being from states that tend to be smurf blue in terms of party loyalty. This polling from swing states paints an entirely different picture. Specifically, if we look at Wisconsin, which polling shows impeachment is a losing battle, especially among independents:

The same can be said of New Hampshire:

Despite this, an anonymous GOP pollster said that this is still bad news for Republicans. That impeachment approval is even this high is still ominous.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a good thing that bare majorities oppose removing Trump from office in these key states,‚Äù said one GOP pollster who requested anonymity. ‚ÄúRemoving the president from office should be a really big deal, almost unthinkable, and reserved for the biggest scandals or wrongdoing. So only eking out 51 percent or 52 percent opposition in these states isn‚Äôt good.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat said, these numbers definitely show that there‚Äôs lots of room for Democrats to handle this badly and hand Trump a second term,‚Äù the pollster continued.

What this does show, however, is that voters are more skeptical than they are sure. As the investigation proceeds, these numbers will no doubt shift, but the question is, by how much? Battleground states are currently leaning away from Trump in general, and even states where he won by double digits like South Carolina have been reduced to single digits. Should the investigation conclude that Trump did nothing wrong ‚Äî again ‚Äî he may experience an approval boost as Democrats once again take themselves to extremes to try to desperately prove their suspicions right.

Time will tell, but the polling proves that Trump isn‚Äôt the one who needs to fight desperately here and it‚Äôs all the Democrat‚Äôs game to lose.",Not Incident
Ivanka Trump brutally mocked after tweet comparing her father to Thomas Jefferson,"On Thursday morning ‚Äî as the House of Representatives was preparing to vote on a resolution to proceed with an impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump ‚Äî his daughter, White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump, took to Twitter and made a Donald Trump/Thomas Jefferson comparison. And it wasn‚Äôt long before she was lambasted for it by fellow Twitter users.

In her Halloween 2019 tweet, Ivanka Trump quoted a letter that Jefferson (the third president of the United States) wrote to his oldest daughter, Martha Jefferson Randolph, in 1801 during an election crisis: ‚Äú‚Ä¶surrounded by enemies and spies catching and perverting every word that falls from my lips or flows from my pen, and inventing where facts fail them.‚Äù Jefferson was describing the state of politics in Washington, D.C., and after quoting him in her tweet, Ivanka Trump wrote, ‚ÄúSome things never change, dad!‚Äù

The implication was that just as Jefferson (who served as president from 1801-1809) was unfairly smeared by politicians in his day, so is her father in 2019. And not surprisingly, many Twitter users disagreed strongly with the comparison.

@ HoarseWisperer angrily responded, ‚ÄúYou are the most vapid tool ever to step foot in the White House,‚Äù and @Amy_Siskind tweeted, ‚ÄúYour family is a crime syndicate running our government.  Hopefully, all of you end up in prison where you belong.‚Äù Another biting quote came from @davehoag, who posted, ‚ÄúDoes anyone know if Thomas Jefferson and Martha Jefferson Randolph also laundered money for Iran‚Äôs Revolutionary Guard?‚Äù

Journalist David Rothkopf explained why a Donald Trump/Thomas Jefferson comparison was wildly inappropriate, posting, ‚ÄúSo, Ivanka, couple things: a.) Jefferson worked his whole life to ensure the president was not above the law b.)  Jefferson was the first top official to call for the impeachment of a president (Washington) for being too close a foreign nation (when he approved the Jay Treaty).‚Äù

Twitter user @maydaymindy9 described the president‚Äôs daughter as ‚Äúan empty vessel in a plastic casing,‚Äù while @RobinMadel posted, ‚ÄúSorry, Ivanka doesn‚Äôt history very well.‚Äù And @Emolclause explained, ‚ÄúWhite House staffers didn‚Äôt throw up their hands in exasperation over Thomas Jefferson‚Äôs LIES.‚Äù

On Thursday, the House voted 232-196 for the impeachment inquiry against President Trump to move forward. The votes came down along mostly partisan lines, with Republicans voting against the resolution and most Democrats voting in favor of it.",Not Incident
OMD celebrate 40 electric years on a night to remember,"The acoustics are sensational but such opulent surroundings can lead to quiet, respectful crowds that sit and watch rather than interact.

But that certainly wasn't the case when OMD brought their 40 Anniversary Tour to Tyneside.

From start to finish, the crowd were clearly intent on winning the prize for the most enthusiastic ever seen at the Sage.

The applause and cheers that followed every song was louder and lengthier than most bands get for an encore. Not bad for an audience that was primarily made up of fans in the their late-40s, 50s and early-60s!

For the best part of two hours, OMD delivered a set mixing their monster hits and most popular album tracks with a couple of rarities, including the b-side of their debut single Electricity, and brilliant new song Don't Go.

The tour is aimed at promoting their new 40th anniversary box set Souvenir and greatest hits collection. But it was clear from their broad grins that founding members Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys wore all night that they were thrilled to be on stage blowing the roof off yet another venue and recieiving such an ecstatic reaction from their fans.

Say what you will about early-80s electronic acts but they have stood the test of time. Human League, Midge Ure, Depeche Mode and OMD all continue to pack in the crowds.

What they have in common is a back catalogue to die for. They all have so many hits that they struggle to squeeze them all in a 90 minute set.

That was the case for OMD, who blasted through brilliant versions of Messages, Tesla Girls, (Forever) Live And Die, Souvenir, Joan Of Arc, So In Love, Locomotion, Sailing On The Seven Seas and Enola Gay, to name just nine classics.

More were to come in the encore, which included their breakthrough US smash If You Leave and the aforementioned Electricity.

Back in the day, OMD weren't 'cool'. Hailing from the Wirral and lacking the street cred of the emerging Liverpool bands from across the Mersey like Echo And The Bunnymen, the critics were sniffy.

It didn't help that the duo looked like middle class student teachers or that McCluskey's 'dancing' ‚Äì which can be best described as a man having one long, continual, up-right seizure ‚Äì destroyed any pretensions of being cool and hip.

But record buyers weren't fussed, they simply loved the music and their fantastic live shows and those fans have helped OMD stand the test of time. Here's to the next 40 years!",Not Incident
Klopp against playing two games on same night amid fixture chaos,"Liverpool are facing fixture uncertainty over when their Carabao Cup quarter-final match will take place.

It was confirmed today by the English Football League that the club were in discussion to work out a date for the game against Aston Villa after beating Arsenal on penalties at Anfield last night, following a thrilling 5-5 draw in normal time.

There were then reports on Thursday evening stating Liverpool and the EFL had discussed the possibility of the Reds playing their League Cup game against Villa on the same night as their semi-final in the FIFA World Club Cup competition on December 18.

However, the ECHO understands Klopp is likely to be against fielding two teams, in two different competitions on the same night.

The League Cup quarter-final ties are due to be played during the week commencing December 16, but that is when Klopp and his side fly out for the Club World Cup in Qatar.

Liverpool will play on the 18th and again on the 21st over in Doha.

The busy Christmas Premier League schedule then follows, so fitting in a Carabao Cup fixture anytime in 2019 looks nigh on impossible.

The most likely night for Liverpool's clash away at Villa in the League Cup is January 8.

Liverpool will face an FA Cup third round clash on the weekend of 4th/5th January - almost certainly on Sunday 5th given they host Sheffield United in the league on the evening of the 2nd.

That potentially leaves Wednesday 8th free. Although, that midweek is when a potential Carabao Cup semi-final first leg would be due to take place.

But it's conceivable that the first game of a semi could be bumped back a week, so the quarter-final and semi-final first leg could take place in consecutive midweeks with the second leg of the semi a fortnight later.

That would mean a quarter-final on 8th of January, and should Liverpool win - a semi-final first leg on 14th/15th with the second leg on Wednesday 29th.",Not Incident

While competitive online gaming has grown exponentially to become a major lucrative industry in recent years, WeWork‚Äôs timing for getting in on the trend is curious, to say the least.
Play by We is said to have spurred two (now expired) job listings by the struggling We Co., which is currently moving to lay off thousands of its existing workforce as SoftBank attempts to salvage it. One of the listed roles on LinkedIn was for ‚Äúcontent and experience manager for Play by We.‚Äù
The news comes just days after WeWork employees met with SoftBank‚Äôs chief operating officer Marcelo Claure at an all-hands meeting, where he addressed the inevitable firings in order to trim WeWork‚Äôs expensive fat.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to be be easy, it‚Äôs going to be bumpy roads,‚Äù said Claure during the meeting. ‚ÄúThis was a race that we were winning and then suddenly, it‚Äôs like we‚Äôve lost momentum, and it‚Äôs hard to regain that momentum. We gotta regain the trust of those corporate customers who are going to think twice: ‚ÄòDo you really have the financial means?‚Äô We gotta make sure that our employees understand that we are never going to go through the existential crisis we just got through.‚Äù
Meanwhile, as a majority stakeholder, SoftBank continues to float the tech unicorn billions in funding in order to keep cash flowing in. The Japanese conglomerate‚Äôs Vision Fund has spent approximately $18.5 billion backing the We Company in the past two years.",Not Incident

And the trio made Ellis' roaster for the high-profile warm-up game scheduled for November 10 in Fukuoka, comprising three goalkeepers, six defenders, nine midfielders and four strikers.

Ellis also offered a maiden call-up to Mamelodi Sundowns striker Lelona Daweti, while recalling Nomvula Kgoale, goalkeeper Jessica Williams and Ongeziwe Ndlangisa to the squad.

A notable omission was Fortuna Hjorring defender Janine Van Wyk, who has not fully recovered from an injury picked up during this year's regional championship in Port Elizabeth in August.

In Van Wyk's absence, assistant captain Jane will lead the team which is scheduled to resume camp on October 1 in Johannesburg.

Meanwhile, Banyana will don a new national team logo against Asako Takakura's side following its unveiling by the South African Football Association at its headquarters in Johannesburg on Thursday.   ‚Äã
